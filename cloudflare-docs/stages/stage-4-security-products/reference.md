## WAF attack score

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/)

Page options # WAF attack score

The attack score traffic detection helps identify variations of known attacks and their malicious payloads. This detection complements WAF Managed Rules.

WAF's managed rulesets contain rules that are continuously updated to better detect malicious payloads. They target specific patterns of established attack vectors and have a very low rate of false positives. However, managed rulesets are not optimized for attacks based on variations of the original signature introduced, for example, by fuzzing techniques.

Attack score allows you to identify these attack variations and their malicious payloads. It classifies each request using a machine learning algorithm, assigning an attack score from 1 to 99 based on the likelihood that the request is malicious. Just like Bot Management, you can use this score to identify potentially malicious traffic that is not an exact match to any of the rules in WAF Managed Rules.

To maximize protection, Cloudflare recommends that you use both Managed Rules and attack score.

Note

This feature is available to Enterprise customers. Business plans have access to a single field (WAF Attack Score Class).

## Available scores

The Cloudflare WAF provides the following attack score fields:

| Field | Description | Required plan |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WAF Attack Score  cf.waf.score  Number | A global score from 1‚Äì99 that combines the score of each WAF attack vector into a single score. | Enterprise |
| WAF SQLi Attack Score  cf.waf.score.sqli  Number | A score from 1‚Äì99 classifying the SQL injection ‚Üó (SQLi) attack vector. | Enterprise |
| WAF XSS Attack Score  cf.waf.score.xss  Number | A score from 1‚Äì99 classifying the cross-site scripting ‚Üó (XSS) attack vector. | Enterprise |
| WAF RCE Attack Score  cf.waf.score.rce  Number | A score from 1‚Äì99 classifying the command injection or remote code execution ‚Üó (RCE) attack vector. | Enterprise |
| WAF Attack Score Class  cf.waf.score.class  String | The attack score class of the current request, based on the WAF attack score.  Possible values: attack, likely_attack, likely_clean, and clean. | Business or above |

You can use these fields in expressions of custom rules and rate limiting rules. Attack score fields of data type Number vary between 1 and 99 with the following meaning:

- A score of 1 indicates that the request is almost certainly malicious.
- A score of 99 indicates that the request is likely clean.

The special score 100 indicates that the Cloudflare WAF did not score the request.

The global WAF Attack Score is mathematically derived from individual attack scores (for example, from SQLi Attack Score and XSS Attack Score), reflecting their interdependence. However, the global score is not a sum of individual scores. A low global score usually indicates medium to low individual scores, while a high global score suggests higher individual scores.

The WAF Attack Score Class field can have one of the following values, depending on the calculated request attack score:

| Dashboard label | Field value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Attack | attack | Attack score between 1 and 20. |
| Likely attack | likely_attack | Attack score between 21 and 50. |
| Likely clean | likely_clean | Attack score between 51 and 80. |
| Clean | clean | Attack score between 81 and 99. |

Requests with the special attack score 100 will show a WAF Attack Score Class of Unscored in the Cloudflare dashboard, but you cannot use this class value in rule expressions.

Attack score automatically detects and decodes Base64, JavaScript (Unicode escape sequences), and URL encoded content anywhere in the request: URL, headers, and body.

## Rule recommendations

Cloudflare does not recommend that you block traffic solely based on the WAF Attack Score for all values below 50, since the Likely attack range (scores between 21 and 50) tends to have false positives. If you want to block traffic based on this score, do one of the following:

- Use a more strict WAF Attack Score value in your expression. For example, block traffic with a WAF attack score below 20 or below 15 (you may need to adjust the exact threshold).
- Combine a higher WAF Attack Score threshold with additional filters when blocking incoming traffic. For example, include a check for a specific URI path in your expression or use bot score as part of your criteria.

## Start using WAF attack score

### 1. Create a custom rule

If you are an Enterprise customer, create a custom rule that blocks requests with a WAF Attack Score less than or equal to 20 (recommended initial threshold). For example:

| Field | Operator | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WAF Attack Score | less than or equal to | 20 |

- Equivalent rule expression: cf.waf.score le 20
- Action: Block

Business customers must create a custom rule with the WAF Attack Score Class field instead. For example, use this field to block incoming requests with a score class of Attack:

| Field | Operator | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WAF Attack Score Class | equals | Attack |

- Equivalent rule expression: cf.waf.score.class eq "attack"
- Action: Block

### 2. Monitor domain traffic

Monitor the rule you created, especially in the first few days, to make sure you entered an appropriate threshold (or class) for your traffic. Update the rule if required.

### 3. Update the rule action

If you are an Enterprise customer and you created a rule with Log action, change the rule action to a more severe one, like Managed Challenge or Block.

## Additional remarks

The WAF attack score is different from bot score. WAF attack score identifies variations of attacks that WAF Managed Rules do not catch, while bot score identifies bots.

## Leaked credentials detection

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/)

Page options # Leaked credentials detection

The leaked credentials traffic detection scans incoming requests for credentials (usernames and passwords) previously leaked from data breaches ‚Üó.

Note

If you are currently using Exposed Credentials Check (a previous implementation) and want to upgrade to leaked credentials detection, refer to our upgrade guide.

## How it works

Once enabled, leaked credentials detection will scan incoming HTTP requests for known authentication patterns from common web apps and any custom detection locations you configure.

If Cloudflare detects authentication credentials in the request, those credentials are checked against a list of known leaked credentials. This list of credentials consists of Cloudflare-collected credentials, in addition to the Have I been Pwned (HIBP) ‚Üó matched passwords dataset.

Cloudflare will populate the existing leaked credentials fields based on the scan results. You can check these results in the Security Analytics dashboard, and use these fields in rule expressions (custom rules or rate limiting rules) to protect your application against the usage of compromised credentials by your end users, and also against leaked credential attacks. Cloudflare may detect leaked credentials either because an attacker is performing a credential stuffing ‚Üó attack or because a legitimate end user is reusing a previously leaked password.

In addition, leaked credentials detection provides a managed transform that adds an Exposed-Credential-Check request header with a value indicating which field was leaked. For example, if both username and password were previously leaked, the header value will be 1; if only the password was leaked, the value will be 4.

One common approach used in web applications when detecting the use of stolen credentials is to warn end users about the situation and ask them to update their password. You can do this based on the managed header received at your origin server.

Note

Cloudflare does not store, log, or retain plaintext end-user passwords when performing leaked credential checks. Passwords are hashed, converted into a cryptographic representation, and then compared against a database of leaked credentials.

## Availability

For details on available features per plan, refer to Availability in the traffic detections page.

## Default scan locations

Leaked credentials detection includes rules for identifying credentials in HTTP requests for the following well-known web applications:

- Drupal
- Joomla
- Ghost
- Magento
- Plone
- WordPress
- Microsoft Exchange OWA

Additionally, the scan includes generic rules for other common web authentication patterns.

You can also configure custom detection locations to address the specific authentication mechanism used in your web applications. A custom detection location tells the Cloudflare WAF where to find usernames and passwords in HTTP requests of your web application.

## Custom detection locations

Note

Only available for Enterprise customers.

Sometimes, you may wish to specify where to find credentials in HTTP requests for the specific case of your web applications.

For example, if the JSON body of an HTTP authenticating a user looked like the following in your web application:

```
{ "user": "<username>", "secret": "<password>" }
```

You could configure a custom detection location with the following settings:

- Custom location for username:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "user")
- Custom location for password:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "secret")

When specifying a custom detection location, only the location of the username field is required.

The following table includes example detection locations for different request types:

| Request type | Username location / Password location |
| --- | --- |
| JSON body | lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "user")lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "secret") |
| URL-encoded form | url_decode(http.request.body.form["user"][0])url_decode(http.request.body.form["secret"][0]) |
| Multipart form | url_decode(http.request.body.multipart["user"][0])url_decode(http.request.body.multipart["secret"][0]) |

Expressions used to specify custom detection locations can include the following fields and functions:

- Fields:

http.request.body.form
http.request.body.multipart
http.request.body.raw
http.request.headers
http.request.uri.query
- http.request.body.form
- http.request.body.multipart
- http.request.body.raw
- http.request.headers
- http.request.uri.query
- Functions:

lookup_json_string()
url_decode()
- lookup_json_string()
- url_decode()

For instructions on configuring a custom detection location, refer to Get started.

## Leaked credentials fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Password Leaked  cf.waf.credential_check.password_leaked  Boolean | Indicates whether the password detected in the request was previously leaked.  Available on all plans. |
| User and Password Leaked  cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked  Boolean | Indicates whether the username-password pair detected in the request were previously leaked.  Requires a Pro plan or above. |
| Username Leaked  cf.waf.credential_check.username_leaked  Boolean | Indicates whether the username detected in the request was previously leaked.  Requires an Enterprise plan. |
| Similar Password Leaked  cf.waf.credential_check.username_password_similar  Boolean | Indicates whether a similar version of the username and password credentials detected in the request were previously leaked.  Requires an Enterprise plan. |
| Authentication detected  cf.waf.auth_detected  Boolean | Indicates whether Cloudflare detected authentication credentials in the request.  Requires an Enterprise plan. |

## Get started

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/get-started/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/get-started/)

Page options # Get started

## 1. Turn on the detection

On Free plans, the leaked credentials detection is enabled by default, and no action is required. On paid plans, you can turn on the detection in the Cloudflare dashboard, via API, or using Terraform.

- Old dashboard
- New dashboard
- API
- Terraform

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings.
3. Under Incoming traffic detections, turn on Leaked credentials.

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings and filter by Detections.
3. Turn on Leaked credential detection.

Use a POST request similar to the following:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following token permissions is required: - Zone WAF Write
- Account WAF Write

Set Leaked Credential Checks Status ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/leaked-credential-checks" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "enabled": true  }'
```

Use the cloudflare_leaked_credential_check resource to enable leaked credentials detection for a zone. For example:

```
resource "cloudflare_leaked_credential_check" "zone_lcc_example" {  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  enabled = true}
```

Note

To achieve optimal latency performance, Cloudflare recommends that you turn off Exposed Credentials Checks (a previous implementation) after turning on leaked credentials detection and setting up your mitigation strategy as described in the next steps.

## 2. Validate the leaked credentials detection behavior

Use Security Analytics and HTTP logs to validate that Cloudflare is correctly detecting leaked credentials in incoming requests.

Refer to Test your configuration for more information on the test credentials you can use to validate your configuration.

Alternatively, create a custom rule like the one described in the next step using a Log action (only available to Enterprise customers). This rule will generate security events that will allow you to validate your configuration.

## 3. Mitigate requests with leaked credentials

If you are on a Free plan, deploy the suggested rate limiting rule template available in:

- Old dashboard: WAF > Rate limiting rules
- New security dashboard: Security > Security rules

When you deploy a rule using this template, you get instant protection against IPs attempting to access your application with a leaked password more than five times per 10 seconds. This rule can delay attacks by blocking them for a period of time. Alternatively, you can create a custom rule.

Paid plans have access to more granular controls when creating a rule. If you are on a paid plan, create a custom rule that challenges requests containing leaked credentials:

| Field | Operator | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User and Password Leaked | equals | True |

If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:

```
(cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked)
```

Rule action: Managed Challenge

This rule will match requests where Cloudflare detects a previously leaked set of credentials (username and password). For a list of fields provided by leaked credentials detection, refer to Leaked credentials fields.

Combine with other Rules language fields

You can combine the previous expression with other fields and functions of the Rules language. This allows you to customize the rule scope or combine leaked credential checking with other security features. For example:

- The following expression will match requests containing leaked credentials addressed at an authentication endpoint:























FieldOperatorValueLogicUser and Password LeakedequalsTrueAndURI Pathcontains/admin/login.php
Expression when using the editor: 
(cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked and http.request.uri.path contains "/admin/login.php")
- The following expression will match requests coming from bots that include authentication credentials:























FieldOperatorValueLogicAuthentication detectedequalsTrueAndBot Scoreless than10
Expression when using the editor: 
(cf.waf.auth_detected and cf.bot_management.score lt 10)

For additional examples, refer to Example mitigation rules.

### Handle detected leaked credentials at the origin server

Additionally, you may want to handle leaked credentials detected by Cloudflare at your origin server:

1. Turn on the Add Leaked Credentials Checks Header managed transform.
2. For requests received at your origin server containing the Exposed-Credential-Check header, you could redirect your end users to your reset password page when detecting previously leaked credentials.

## 4. (Optional) Configure a custom detection location

To check for leaked credentials in a way that is not covered by the default configuration, add a custom detection location.

- Old dashboard
- New dashboard
- API
- Terraform

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings.
3. Under Incoming traffic detections, select Leaked credentials and then select Add custom username and password location.
4. In Username location and Password location (optional), enter expressions for obtaining the username and the password from the HTTP request. For example, you could use the following expressions:

Username location:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "user")
Password location:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "secret")

This configuration will scan incoming HTTP requests containing a JSON body with a structure similar to the following:
{"user": "<USERNAME>", "secret": "<PASSWORD>"}
Refer to the lookup_json_string() documentation for more information on this function.
5. Username location:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "user")
6. Password location:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "secret")
7. Select Save.

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings and filter by Detections.
3. Under Leaked credential detection > Configurations, select the edit icon.
4. Select Add custom username and password location.
5. In Username location and Password location (optional), enter expressions for obtaining the username and the password from the HTTP request. For example, you could use the following expressions:

Username location:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "user")
Password location:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "secret")

This configuration will scan incoming HTTP requests containing a JSON body with a structure similar to the following:
{"user": "<USERNAME>", "secret": "<PASSWORD>"}
Refer to the lookup_json_string() documentation for more information on this function.
6. Username location:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "user")
7. Password location:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "secret")
8. Select Save.

Use a POST request similar to the following:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following token permissions is required: - Zone WAF Write
- Account WAF Write

Create Leaked Credential Checks Custom Detection ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/leaked-credential-checks/detections" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "username": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"user\")",    "password": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"secret\")"  }'
```

This pair of lookup expressions (for username and password) will scan incoming HTTP requests containing a JSON body with a structure similar to the following:

```
{"user": "<USERNAME>", "secret": "<PASSWORD>"}
```

Refer to the lookup_json_string() documentation for more information on this function.

Use the cloudflare_leaked_credential_check_rule resource to add a custom detection location. For example:

```
resource "cloudflare_leaked_credential_check_rule" "custom_location_example" {  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  username = "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"user\")"  password = "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"secret\")"}
```

Refer to the lookup_json_string() documentation for more information on this function.

You only need to provide an expression for the username in custom detection locations.

For more examples of custom detection locations for different request types, refer to Custom detection locations.

## Test your configuration

Cloudflare provides a special set of case-sensitive credentials for testing the configuration of the leaked credentials detection.

After enabling and configuring the detection, you can use the credentials mentioned in this section in your test HTTP requests.

Test credentials for users on a Free plan (will also work in paid plans):

- Username: CF_LEAKED_USERNAME_FREE
- Password: CF_LEAKED_PASSWORD

Test credentials for users on paid plans (will not work on Free plans):

- Username: CF_EXPOSED_USERNAME or CF_EXPOSED_USERNAME@example.com
- Password: CF_EXPOSED_PASSWORD

Cloudflare considers these specific credentials as having been previously leaked. Use them in your tests to check the behavior of your current configuration.

## Terraform configuration examples

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/terraform-examples/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/terraform-examples/)

Page options # Terraform configuration examples

The following Terraform configuration examples address common scenarios for managing, configuring, and using leaked credentials detection.

For more information, refer to the Terraform Cloudflare provider documentation ‚Üó.

If you are using the Cloudflare API, refer to Common API calls.

## Enable leaked credentials detection

Use the cloudflare_leaked_credential_check resource to enable leaked credentials detection for a zone. For example:

```
resource "cloudflare_leaked_credential_check" "zone_lcc_example" {  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  enabled = true}
```

## Configure a custom detection location

Use the cloudflare_leaked_credential_check_rule resource to add a custom detection location. For example:

```
resource "cloudflare_leaked_credential_check_rule" "custom_location_example" {  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  username = "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"user\")"  password = "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"secret\")"}
```

You only need to provide an expression for the username in custom detection locations.

## Add a custom rule to challenge requests with leaked credentials

This example adds a custom rule that challenges requests with leaked credentials by using one of the leaked credentials fields in the rule expression.

To use the cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked field you must enable leaked credentials detection.

Note

Terraform code snippets below refer to the v4 SDK only.

```
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "zone_custom_firewall_leaked_creds" {  zone_id     = "<ZONE_ID>"  name        = "Phase entry point ruleset for custom rules in my zone"  description = ""  kind        = "zone"  phase       = "http_request_firewall_custom"
  rules {    ref         = "challenge_leaked_username_password"    description = "Challenge requests with a leaked username and password"    expression  = "(cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked)"    action      = "managed_challenge"  }}
```

## Example mitigation rules

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/examples/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/examples/)

Page options # Example mitigation rules

## Rate limit suspicious logins with leaked credentials

Note

Access to the cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked field requires a Pro plan or above.

Create a rate limiting rule using account takeover (ATO) detection and leaked credentials fields to limit volumetric attacks from particular IP addresses, JA4 Fingerprints, or countries.

The following example rule applies rate limiting to requests with a specific ATO detection ID (corresponding to Observes all login traffic to the zone) that contain a previously leaked username and password:



When incoming requests match:
(any(cf.bot_management.detection_ids[*] eq 201326593 and cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked))

With the same characteristics: IP

When rate exceeds:

- Requests: 5
- Period: 1 minute

## Challenge requests containing leaked credentials

Note

Access to the User and Password Leaked (cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked) field requires a Pro plan or above.

Create a custom rule that challenges requests containing a previously leaked set of credentials (username and password).

- Expression: If you use the Expression Builder, configure the following expression:















FieldOperatorValueUser and Password LeakedequalsTrue
If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:
(cf.waf.credential_check.username_and_password_leaked)
- Action: Managed Challenge

## Malicious uploads detection

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/)

Page options # Malicious uploads detection

The malicious uploads detection, also called uploaded content scanning, is a WAF traffic detection that scans content being uploaded to your application.

When enabled, content scanning attempts to detect content objects, such as uploaded files, and scans them for malicious signatures like malware. The scan results, along with additional metadata, are exposed as fields available in WAF custom rules, allowing you to implement fine-grained mitigation rules.

Note

This feature is available to customers on an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

## How it works

Once enabled, content scanning will run for all incoming traffic, identifying content objects automatically.

For every request with one or more detected content objects, the content scanner connects to an antivirus (AV) scanner to perform a thorough analysis of the content objects. Using the results of the scan, the WAF will populate several fields you can use in rule expressions. For example, you can create a basic rule to block requests containing malicious files, or a more complex rule where the expression matches specific file sizes, file types, or URI paths.

Cloudflare uses the same anti-virus (AV) scanner used in Cloudflare Zero Trust for WAF content scanning.

Note

Content scanning will not apply any mitigation actions to requests with content objects considered malicious. It only provides a signal that you can use to define your attack mitigation strategy. You must create rules ‚Äî custom rules or rate limiting rules ‚Äî to perform actions based on detected signals.

For more information on detection versus mitigation, refer to Concepts.

## What is a content object?

A content object is any request payload detected by heuristics that does not match any of the following types: text/html, text/x-shellscript, application/json, text/csv, and text/xml. All other content types are considered a content object, such as the following:

- Executable files (for example, .exe, .bat, .dll, and .wasm)
- Documents (for example, .doc, .docx, .pdf, .ppt, and .xls)
- Compressed files (for example, .gz, .zip, and .rar)
- Image files (for example, .jpg, .png, .gif, .webp, and .tif)
- Video and audio files

Content scanning does not take the request's Content-Type header into account, since this header can be manipulated. If the system detects a malicious object but cannot determine its exact content type, it reports the malicious content object as having an application/octet-stream content type.

## Scanned content

Content scanning can check the following content objects for malicious content:

- Uploaded files in a request
- Portions of the request body for multipart requests encoded as multipart/form-data or multipart/mixed
- Specific JSON properties in the request body (containing, for example, files encoded in Base64) according to the custom scan expressions you provide

All content objects in an incoming request will be checked, namely for requests with multiple uploaded files (for example, a submitted HTML form with several file inputs).

The content scanner will fully check content objects with a size up to 30 MB. For larger content objects, the scanner will analyze the first 30 MB and provide scan results based on that portion of the object.

Note

The AV scanner will not scan some particular types of files, namely the following:

- Password-protected archives
- Archives with more than three recursion levels
- Archives with more than 300 files
- PGP-encrypted files

## Custom scan expressions

Sometimes, you may want to specify where to find the content objects, such as when the content is a Base64-encoded string within a JSON payload. For example:

```
{ "file": "<BASE64_ENCODED_STRING>" }
```

In these situations, configure a custom scan expression to tell the content scanner where to find the content objects. For more information, refer to Configure a custom scan expression.

For more information and additional examples of looking up fields in nested JSON payloads, refer to the lookup_json_string() function documentation.

Note

The content scanner will automatically decode Base64 strings.

## Content scanning fields

When content scanning is enabled, you can use the following fields in WAF rules:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Has content object  cf.waf.content_scan.has_obj  Boolean | Indicates whether the request contains at least one content object. |
| Has malicious content object  cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj  Boolean | Indicates whether the request contains at least one malicious content object. |
| Number of malicious content objects  cf.waf.content_scan.num_malicious_obj  Integer | The number of malicious content objects detected in the request (zero or greater). |
| Content scan has failed  cf.waf.content_scan.has_failed  Boolean | Indicates whether the file scanner was unable to scan all the content objects detected in the request. |
| Number of content objects  cf.waf.content_scan.num_obj  Integer | The number of content objects detected in the request (zero or greater). |
| Content object size  cf.waf.content_scan.obj_sizes  Array<Integer> | An array of file sizes in bytes, in the order the content objects were detected in the request. |
| Content object type  cf.waf.content_scan.obj_types  Array<String> | An array of file types in the order the content objects were detected in the request. |
| Content object result  cf.waf.content_scan.obj_results  Array<String> | An array of scan results in the order the content objects were detected in the request.  Possible values: clean, suspicious, infected, and not scanned. |

For examples of rule expressions using these fields, refer to Example rules.

## Get started

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/get-started/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/get-started/)

Page options # Get started

Note

WAF content scanning is available to customers on an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

## 1. Turn on the detection

- Old dashboard
- New dashboard
- API
- Terraform

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings.
3. Under Incoming traffic detections, turn on Malicious uploads.

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings and filter by Detections.
3. Turn on Malicious uploads detection.

Use a POST request similar to the following:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following token permissions is required: - Zone WAF Write
- Account WAF Write

Enable Content Scanning ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/content-upload-scan/enable" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
```

Use the cloudflare_content_scanning resource to enable content scanning for a zone. For example:

```
resource "cloudflare_content_scanning" "zone_content_scanning_example" {  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  enabled = true}
```

## 2. Validate the content scanning behavior

Use Security Analytics and HTTP logs to validate that malicious content objects are being detected correctly.

You can use the EICAR anti-malware test file ‚Üó to test content scanning (select the ZIP format).

Alternatively, create a custom rule like described in the next step using a Log action instead of a mitigation action like Block. This rule will generate security events that will allow you to validate your configuration.

## 3. Create a custom rule

Create a custom rule that blocks detected malicious content objects uploaded to your application.

For example, create a custom rule with the Block action and the following expression:

| Field | Operator | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Has malicious content object | equals | True |

If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:

```
(cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj)
```

Rule action: Block

This rule will match requests where Cloudflare detects a suspicious or malicious content object. For a list of fields provided by WAF content scanning, refer to Content scanning fields.

Optional: Combine with other Rules language fields

You can combine the previous expression with other fields and functions of the Rules language. This allows you to customize the rule scope or combine content scanning with other security features. For example:

- The following expression will match requests with malicious content objects uploaded to a specific endpoint:























FieldOperatorValueLogicHas malicious content objectequalsTrueAndURI Pathcontainsupload.php
Expression when using the editor:
(cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj and http.request.uri.path contains "upload.php")
- The following expression will match requests from bots uploading content objects:























FieldOperatorValueLogicHas content objectequalsTrueAndBot Scoreless than10
Expression when using the editor:
(cf.waf.content_scan.has_obj and cf.bot_management.score lt 10)

For additional examples, refer to Example rules.

## 4. (Optional) Configure a custom scan expression

To check uploaded content in a way that is not covered by the default configuration, add a custom scan expression.

- Old dashboard
- New dashboard
- API
- Terraform

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings.
3. Under Incoming traffic detections, select Malicious uploads.
4. Select Add content object location.
5. In Content location, enter your custom scan expression. For example:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "file")
6. Select Save.

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings and filter by Detections.
3. Under Malicious uploads detection > Configurations, select the edit icon.
4. Select Add content location.
5. In Content location, enter your custom scan expression. For example:
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "file")
6. Select Save.

Use a POST request similar to the following:

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following token permissions is required: - Zone WAF Write
- Account WAF Write

Add Custom Scan Expressions ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/content-upload-scan/payloads" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '[    {        "payload": "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"file\")"    }  ]'
```

The above request will add the following expression to the current list of custom scan expressions:

```
lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, "file")
```

Use the cloudflare_content_scanning_expression resource to add a custom scan expression. For example:

```
resource "cloudflare_content_scanning_expression" "my_custom_scan_expression" {  zone_id = <ZONE_ID>  payload = "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"file\")"}
```

For more information, refer to Custom scan expressions.

## Example rules

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/example-rules/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/example-rules/)

Page options # Example rules

## Log requests with an uploaded content object

This custom rule example logs all requests with at least one uploaded content object:

- Expression: cf.waf.content_scan.has_obj
- Action: Log

## Block requests to URI path with a malicious content object

This custom rule example blocks requests addressed at /upload.php that contain at least one uploaded content object considered malicious:

- Expression: cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj and http.request.uri.path eq "/upload.php"
- Action: Block

## Block requests with non-PDF file uploads

This custom rule example blocks requests addressed at /upload with uploaded content objects that are not PDF files:

- Expression: any(cf.waf.content_scan.obj_types[*] != "application/pdf") and http.request.uri.path eq "/upload"
- Action: Block

## Block requests with uploaded files over 500 KB

This custom rule example blocks requests addressed at /upload with uploaded content objects over 500 KB (512,000 bytes) in size:

- Expression: any(cf.waf.content_scan.obj_sizes[*] > 512000) and http.request.uri.path eq "/upload"
- Action: Block

## Block requests with uploaded files over the content scanning limit (30 MB)

This custom rule example blocks requests with uploaded content objects over 30 MB in size (the current content scanning limit):

- Expression: any(cf.waf.content_scan.obj_sizes[*] >= 31457280)
- Action: Block

In this example, you must also test for equality because currently any file over 30 MB will be handled internally as if it had a size of 30 MB (31,457,280 bytes). This means that using the > (greater than) comparison operator would not work for this particular rule ‚Äî you should use >= (greater than or equal) instead.

## Terraform configuration examples

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/terraform-examples/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/malicious-uploads/terraform-examples/)

Page options # Terraform configuration examples

The following Terraform configuration examples address common scenarios for managing, configuring, and using WAF content scanning.

For more information, refer to the Terraform Cloudflare provider documentation ‚Üó.

If you are using the Cloudflare API, refer to Common API calls.

## Enable WAF content scanning

Use the cloudflare_content_scanning resource to enable content scanning for a zone. For example:

```
resource "cloudflare_content_scanning" "zone_content_scanning_example" {  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  enabled = true}
```

## Configure a custom scan expression

Use the cloudflare_content_scanning_expression resource to add a custom scan expression. For example:

```
resource "cloudflare_content_scanning_expression" "my_custom_scan_expression" {  zone_id = <ZONE_ID>  payload = "lookup_json_string(http.request.body.raw, \"file\")"}
```

For more information, refer to Custom scan expressions.

## Add a custom rule to block malicious uploads

This example adds a custom rule that blocks requests with one or more content objects considered malicious by using one of the content scanning fields in the rule expression.

To use the cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj field you must enable content scanning.

Note

Terraform code snippets below refer to the v4 SDK only.

```
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "zone_custom_firewall_malicious_uploads" {  zone_id     = "<ZONE_ID>"  name        = "Phase entry point ruleset for custom rules in my zone"  description = ""  kind        = "zone"  phase       = "http_request_firewall_custom"
  rules {    ref         = "block_malicious_uploads"    description = "Block requests uploading malicious content objects"    expression  = "(cf.waf.content_scan.has_malicious_obj and http.request.uri.path eq \"/upload.php\")"    action      = "block"  }}
```

## Firewall for AI (beta)

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/firewall-for-ai/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/firewall-for-ai/)

Page options # Firewall for AI (beta)

Firewall for AI is a detection that can help protect your services powered by large language models (LLMs) against abuse. This model-agnostic detection currently helps you do the following:

- Prevent data leaks of personally identifiable information (PII) ‚Äî for example, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and credit card numbers.
- Detect and moderate unsafe or harmful prompts ‚Äì for example, prompts potentially related to violent crimes.
- Detect prompts intentionally designed to subvert the intended behavior of the LLM as specified by the developer ‚Äì for example, prompt injection attacks.

When enabled, the detection runs on incoming traffic, searching for any LLM prompts attempting to exploit the model.

Cloudflare will populate the existing Firewall for AI fields based on the scan results. You can check these results in the Security Analytics dashboard by filtering on the cf-llm managed endpoint label and reviewing the detection results on your traffic. Additionally, you can use these fields in rule expressions (custom rules or rate limiting rules) to protect your application against LLM abuse and data leaks.

## Availability

Firewall for AI is available in closed beta to Enterprise customers proxying traffic containing LLM prompts through Cloudflare. Contact your account team to get access.

## Get started

### 1. Turn on Firewall for AI

- New dashboard
- API

Note

Firewall for AI is only available in the new application security dashboard.

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > Settings and filter by Detections.
3. Turn on Firewall for AI.

Enable the feature using a PUT request similar to the following:

Terminal window ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/firewall-for-ai/settings" \--request PUT \--header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \--json '{ "pii_detection_enabled": true }'
```

### 2. Validate the detection behavior

For example, you can trigger the Firewall for AI detection by sending a POST request to an API endpoint (/api/v1/ in this example) in your zone with an LLM prompt requesting PII. The API endpoint must have been added to API Shield and have a cf-llm managed endpoint label.

Terminal window ```
curl "https://<YOUR_HOSTNAME>/api/v1/" \--header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \--json '{ "prompt": "Provide the phone number for the person associated with example@example.com" }'
```

The PII category for this request would be EMAIL_ADDRESS.

Then, use Security Analytics in the new application security dashboard to validate that the WAF is correctly detecting potentially harmful prompts in incoming requests. Filter data by the cf-llm managed endpoint label and review the detection results on your traffic.

Alternatively, create a custom rule like the one described in the next step using a Log action. This rule will generate security events that will allow you to validate your configuration.

### 3. Mitigate harmful requests

Create a custom rule that blocks requests where Cloudflare detected personally identifiable information (PII) in the incoming request (as part of an LLM prompt), returning a custom JSON body:

- If incoming requests match:















FieldOperatorValueLLM PII DetectedequalsTrue
If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:
(cf.llm.prompt.pii_detected)
- Rule action: Block
- With response type: Custom JSON
- Response body: { "error": "Your request was blocked. Please rephrase your request." }

For additional examples, refer to Example mitigation rules. For a list of fields provided by Firewall for AI, refer to Fields.

Combine with other Rules language fields

You can combine the previous expression with other fields and functions of the Rules language. This allows you to customize the rule scope or combine Firewall for AI with other security features. For example:

- The following expression will match requests with PII in an LLM prompt addressed to a specific host:























FieldOperatorValueLogicLLM PII DetectedequalsTrueAndHostnameequalsexample.com
Expression when using the editor: 
(cf.llm.prompt.pii_detected and http.host == "example.com")
- The following expression will match requests coming from bots that include PII in an LLM prompt:























FieldOperatorValueLogicLLM PII DetectedequalsTrueAndBot Scoreless than10
Expression when using the editor: 
(cf.llm.prompt.pii_detected and cf.bot_management.score lt 10)

## Firewall for AI fields

When enabled, Firewall for AI populates the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| LLM PII detected  cf.llm.prompt.pii_detected  Boolean | Indicates whether any personally identifiable information (PII) has been detected in the LLM prompt included in the request. |
| LLM PII categories  cf.llm.prompt.pii_categories  Array<String> | Array of string values with the personally identifiable information (PII) categories found in the LLM prompt included in the request.Category list |
| LLM Content detected  cf.llm.prompt.detected  Boolean | Indicates whether Cloudflare detected an LLM prompt in the incoming request. |
| LLM Unsafe topic detected  cf.llm.prompt.unsafe_topic_detected  Boolean | Indicates whether the incoming request includes any unsafe topic category in the LLM prompt. |
| LLM Unsafe topic categories  cf.llm.prompt.unsafe_topic_categories  Array<String> | Array of string values with the type of unsafe topics detected in the LLM prompt.Category list |
| LLM Injection score  cf.llm.prompt.injection_score  Number | A score from 1‚Äì99 that represents the likelihood that the LLM prompt in the request is trying to perform a prompt injection attack. |

## Example mitigation rules

### Block requests with specific PII category in LLM prompt

The following example custom rule will block requests with an LLM prompt that tries to obtain PII of a specific category:

- If incoming requests match:















FieldOperatorValueLLM PII Categoriesis inCredit Card
If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:
(any(cf.llm.prompt.pii_categories[*] in {"CREDIT_CARD"}))
- Action: Block

### Block requests with specific unsafe content categories in LLM prompt

The following example custom rule will block requests with an LLM prompt containing unsafe content of specific categories:

- If incoming requests match:















FieldOperatorValueLLM Unsafe topic categoriesis inS1: Violent Crimes S10: Hate
If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:
(any(cf.llm.prompt.unsafe_topic_categories[*] in {"S1" "S10"}))
- Action: Block

### Block requests with prompt injection attempt in LLM prompt

The following example custom rule will block requests with an injection score below 20. Using a low injection score value in the rule helps avoid false positives.

- If incoming requests match:















FieldOperatorValueLLM Injection scoreless than20
If you use the Expression Editor, enter the following expression:
(cf.llm.prompt.injection_score < 20)
- Action: Block

## Custom rulesets

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/)

Page options # Custom rulesets

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

Custom rulesets are collections of custom rules that you can deploy at the account level.

Like custom rules at the zone level, custom rulesets allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests. You can apply a custom ruleset to all incoming traffic of your Enterprise domains or to a subset of incoming requests.

Refer to the following pages for more information on working with custom rulesets:

- Work with custom rulesets in the dashboard
- Work with custom rulesets using the API

For Terraform examples, refer to WAF custom rules configuration using Terraform.

## Lists

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/)

Page options # Lists

Use lists to refer to a group of items (such as IP addresses) collectively, by name, in rule expressions of Cloudflare products. You can create your own custom lists or use lists managed by Cloudflare, such as Managed IP Lists.

Lists have the following advantages:

- When creating a rule, using a list is easier and less error-prone than adding a long list of items such as IP addresses to a rule expression.
- When updating a set of rules that target the same group of IP addresses (or hostnames), using an IP list (or a hostname list) is easier and less error prone than editing multiple rules.
- Lists are easier to read and more informative, particularly when you use descriptive names for your lists.

When you update the content of a list, any rules that use the list are automatically updated, so you can make a single change to your list rather than modify rules individually.

Cloudflare stores your lists at the account level. You can use the same list in rules of different zones in your Cloudflare account.

## Supported lists

Cloudflare supports the following lists:

- Custom lists: Includes custom IP lists, hostname lists, and ASN lists.
- Managed Lists: Lists managed and updated by Cloudflare, such as Managed IP Lists.

Refer to each page for details.

Note

Bulk Redirects use Bulk Redirect Lists, a different type of list covered in the Rules documentation.

## List names

The name of a list must comply with the following requirements:

- The name uses only lowercase letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character in the name. A valid name satisfies this regular expression: ^[a-z0-9_]+$.
- The maximum length of a list name is 50 characters.

## Work with lists

### Create and edit lists

You can create lists in the Cloudflare dashboard or using the Lists API.

After creating a list, you can add and remove items from the list, but you cannot change the list name or type.

### Use lists in expressions

Both the Cloudflare dashboard and the Cloudflare API support lists:

- To use lists in an expression from the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to Use lists in expressions.
- To reference a list in an API expression, refer to Values: Lists in the Rules language reference.

Warning

Currently, not all Cloudflare products support lists in their expressions. Refer to the documentation of each individual product for details on list support.

### Search list items

You can search for list items in the dashboard or via API.

For IP Lists, Cloudflare will return IP addresses/ranges that start with your search query (search by prefix). Currently, you cannot search for an IP address contained in a CIDR range of an IP List.

For Bulk Redirect Lists, Cloudflare will return the URL redirects in the list where the source URL or target URL contain your search query (search by substring).

## Availability

List availability varies according to the list type and your Cloudflare plan and subscriptions.

|  | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Availability | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Number of custom lists (any type) | 1 | 10 | 10 | 1,000 |
| Max. number of list items (across all custom lists) | 10,000 | 10,000 | 10,000 | 500,000 |
| IP lists | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Other custom lists (hostnames, ASNs) | No | No | No | Yes |
| Managed IP List: Cloudflare Open Proxies | No | No | No | Yes |
| All Managed IP Lists | No | No | No | With separate add-on |

Notes:

- The number of available custom lists depends on the highest plan in your account. Any account with at least one paid plan will get the highest quota.
- Customers on Enterprise plans can create a maximum of 1,000 custom lists in total across different list types. The following additional limits apply:

Up to 40 hostname lists, with a maximum of 10,000 list items across all hostname lists.
Up to 40 ASN lists, with a maximum of 30,000 list items across all ASN lists.
- Up to 40 hostname lists, with a maximum of 10,000 list items across all hostname lists.
- Up to 40 ASN lists, with a maximum of 30,000 list items across all ASN lists.
- The Cloudflare Enterprise plan provides access to the Cloudflare Open Proxies Managed IP List. Other Managed IP Lists are available as part of Enterprise Security Bundles. For more information, contact your account team.
- Customers on Enterprise plans may contact their account team if they need more custom lists or a larger maximum number of items across lists.
- For details on the availability of Bulk Redirect Lists, refer to the Rules documentation.

## User role requirements

The following user roles have access to the list management functionality:

- Super Administrator
- Administrator
- Firewall

## Final remarks

You can only delete a list when there are no rules (enabled or disabled) that reference that list.

Cloudflare will apply the following rules when you add items to an existing list (either manually or via CSV file):

- Do not remove any existing list items before updating/adding items.
- Update items that were already in the list.
- Add items that were not present in the list.

To replace the entire contents of a list, format the data as an array and use the Update all list items operation in the Lists API.

You cannot download a list in CSV format from the Cloudflare dashboard. If you need to download the contents of a list, use the Get list items operation to fetch the list items.

## Custom lists

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/)

Page options # Custom lists

A custom list contains one or more items of the same type (for example, IP addresses, hostnames, or ASNs) that you can reference collectively, by name, in rule expressions.

Cloudflare supports the following custom list types:

- Lists with IP addresses (also known as IP lists)
- Lists with hostnames
- Lists with ASNs (autonomous system ‚Üó numbers)

Note

Lists with hostnames and ASNs are only available to Enterprise customers. Refer to Availability for details.

Each type has its own properties and CSV file format. Refer to the following sections for details.

For more information on lists managed by Cloudflare, such as Managed IP Lists, refer to Managed Lists.

## Create a custom list

Refer to Create a list in the dashboard or to the Lists API page.

## Use a custom list

Use custom lists in rule expressions with the in operator and with a field supported by the custom list:

```
<FIELD> in $<LIST_NAME>
```

The fields you can use vary according to the list item type:

| List item type | Available fields |
| --- | --- |
| IP address | Fields with type IP address listed in the Fields reference |
| Hostname | http.host |
| ASN | ip.src.asnum |

For more information and examples, refer to Use lists in expressions.

## Custom list types

### Lists with IP addresses (IP lists)

List items in custom lists with IP addresses must be in one of the following formats:

- Individual IPv4 addresses
- Individual IPv6 addresses
- IPv4 CIDR ranges with a prefix from /8 to /32
- IPv6 CIDR ranges with a prefix from /12 to /128

The same list can contain both individual addresses and CIDR ranges.

You can use uppercase or lowercase characters for IPv6 addresses in lists. However, when you save the list, uppercase characters are converted to lowercase.

CSV file format

When uploading items to a custom list with IP addresses via CSV file, use the following file format (enter one item per line):

```
<IP_ADDRESS_1>,<DESCRIPTION><IP_ADDRESS_2>
```

The <DESCRIPTION> field is optional.

### Lists with hostnames

Note

Available to Enterprise customers.

List items in custom lists with hostnames must be Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs). An item may contain a * prefix/subdomain wildcard, which must be followed by a . (period). An item cannot include a scheme (for example, https://) or a URL path.

For example, the following entries would be valid for a custom list with hostnames:

- example.com
- api.example.com
- *.example.com

However, example.com/path/subfolder would not be a valid entry.

You can add any valid hostname (a valid FQDN) to a custom list with hostnames. The hostnames do not need to belong to the current Cloudflare account.

CSV file format

When uploading items to a custom list with hostnames via CSV file, use the following file format:

```
<HOSTNAME_1>,<DESCRIPTION><HOSTNAME_2>
```

The <DESCRIPTION> field is optional.

### Lists with ASNs

Note

Available to Enterprise customers.

List items in custom lists with autonomous system numbers (ASNs) must be integer values.

For example, the following entries would be valid for a list with ASNs:

- 1
- 13335
- 64512

CSV file format

When uploading items to a custom list with ASNs via CSV file, use the following file format:

```
<ASN_1>,<DESCRIPTION><ASN_2>
```

The <DESCRIPTION> field is optional.

## Use lists in expressions

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/use-in-expressions/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/use-in-expressions/)

Page options # Use lists in expressions

In the Cloudflare dashboard, there are two options for editing expressions:

- Expression Builder: Allows you to create expressions using drop-down lists, emphasizing a visual approach to defining an expression.
- Expression Editor: A text-only interface that supports advanced features, such as grouping symbols and functions for transforming and validating values.

## Expression Builder

To use a list in the Expression Builder:

1. Select is in list or is not in list from the Operator drop-down list.
2. Select a list from the Value drop-down list. Depending on your plan, you may be able to select a Managed IP List.
3. To commit your changes and enable the rule, select Deploy. If you are not ready to enable the rule, select Save as Draft.

## Expression Editor

To use a list in the Expression Editor, specify the in operator and use $<list_name> to specify the name of the list.

Examples:

- Expression matching requests from IP addresses that are in an IP list named office_network:
ip.src in $office_network
- Expression matching requests with a source IP address different from IP addresses in the office_network IP list:
not ip.src in $office_network
- Expression matching requests from IP addresses in the Cloudflare Open Proxies Managed IP List:
ip.src in $cf.open_proxies

## Lists API

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/)

Page options # Lists API

The Lists API provides an interface for programmatically managing the following types of lists:

- Custom lists: Contain one or more strings of the same type (such as IP addresses or hostnames) that you can reference collectively, by name, in rule expressions.
- Bulk Redirect Lists: Contain URL redirects that you enable by creating a Bulk Redirect Rule.

To use a list in a rule expression, refer to Values: Lists in the Rules language documentation.

## Get started

To get started, review the Lists JSON object and Endpoints.

## Rate limiting for Lists API requests

Cloudflare may apply rate limiting to your API requests creating, modifying, or deleting list items in custom lists and Bulk Redirect Lists.

Each operation (create, edit, or delete) on a list item counts as a modification. The following limits apply:

- You can make a maximum of 1,000,000 list item modifications in API requests over 12 hours.
- You can make a maximum of 30,000 API requests over 12 hours doing list item modifications.

## Endpoints

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/endpoints/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/lists-api/endpoints/)

Page options # Endpoints

To invoke a Lists API operation, append the endpoint to the Cloudflare API base URL:

https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/

For authentication instructions, refer to Cloudflare's API: Get started.

For help with making API calls and paginating results, refer to Make API calls.

Note

The Lists API endpoints require a value for {account_id}.

To retrieve a list of accounts to which you have access, use the List Accounts operation and note the IDs of the accounts you want to manage.

The Lists API supports the operations outlined below. Visit the associated links for examples.

## Manage lists

### Create a list

- Operation: Create a list
- Method and endpoint: POST accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists
- Notes: Creates an empty list.

### Get lists

- Operation: Get lists
- Method and endpoint: GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists
- Notes:

Fetches all lists for the account.
This request does not fetch the items in the lists.
- Fetches all lists for the account.
- This request does not fetch the items in the lists.

### Get a list

- Operation: Get a list
- Method and endpoint: GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}
- Notes:

Fetches a list by its ID.
This request does not display the items in the list.
- Fetches a list by its ID.
- This request does not display the items in the list.

### Update a list

- Operation: Update a list
- Method and endpoint: PUT accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}
- Notes:

Updates the description of a list.
You cannot edit the name or kind, and you cannot update items in a list. To update an item in a list, use the Update all list items operation.
- Updates the description of a list.
- You cannot edit the name or kind, and you cannot update items in a list. To update an item in a list, use the Update all list items operation.

### Delete a list

- Operation: Delete a list
- Method and endpoint: DELETE accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}
- Notes: Deletes the list, but only when no filters reference it.

## Manage items in a list

Nearly all the operations for managing items in a list are asynchronous. When you add or delete a large amount of items to or from a list, there may be a delay before the bulk operation is complete.

Asynchronous list operations return an operation_id, which you can use to monitor the status of an API operation. To monitor the status of an asynchronous operation, use the Get bulk operation status endpoint and specify the ID of the operation you want to monitor.

When you make requests to a list while a bulk operation on that list is in progress, the requests are queued and processed in sequence (first in, first out). Requests for successful asynchronous operations return an HTTP 201 status code.

### Get list items

- Operation: Get list items
- Method and endpoint: GET accounts/{account_id}/rules/lists/{list_id}/items[?search={query}]
- Notes:

Fetches items in a list (all items, by default).
Items are sorted in ascending order.

## IP Access rules

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/)

Page options # IP Access rules

Use IP Access rules to allowlist, block, and challenge traffic based on the visitor's IP address, country, or Autonomous System Number (ASN).

IP Access rules are commonly used to block or challenge suspected malicious traffic. Another common use of IP Access rules is to allow services that regularly access your site, such as APIs, crawlers, and payment providers.

Warning

- Allowing an IP, ASN, or country will bypass any configured custom rules, rate limiting rules, and firewall rules (deprecated).
- Allowing a country will not bypass WAF Managed Rules or WAF managed rules (previous version).

## Recommendation: Use custom rules instead

Cloudflare recommends that you create custom rules instead of IP Access rules to perform IP-based or geography-based blocking (geoblocking):

- For IP-based blocking, use an IP list in the custom rule expression.
- For geoblocking, use fields such as AS Num, Country, and Continent in the custom rule expression.

## Availability

IP Access rules are available to all customers.

Each Cloudflare account can have a maximum of 50,000 rules. If you are an Enterprise customer and need more rules, contact your account team.

Block by country is only available on the Enterprise plan. Other customers may perform country blocking using WAF custom rules.

## Final remarks

- By design, IP Access rules configured to Allow traffic do not show up in Security Events.
- Requests containing certain attack patterns in the User-Agent field are checked before being processed by the general firewall pipeline. Therefore, such requests are blocked before any allowlist logic takes place. When this occurs, security events downloaded from the API show rule_id as security_level and action as drop.
- Cloudflare supports use of fail2ban to block IPs on your server. However, to prevent fail2ban from inadvertently blocking Cloudflare IPs and causing errors for some visitors, ensure you restore original visitor IP in your origin server logs. For details, refer to Restoring original visitor IPs.

## Actions

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/actions/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/actions/)

Page options # Actions

An IP Access rule can perform one of the following actions:

- Block: Prevents a visitor from visiting your site.
- Allow: Excludes visitors from all security checks, including Browser Integrity Check, Under Attack mode, and the WAF. Use this option when a trusted visitor is being blocked by Cloudflare's default security features. The Allow action takes precedence over the Block action. Note that allowing a given country code will not bypass WAF managed rules (previous and new versions).
- Managed Challenge: Depending on the characteristics of a request, Cloudflare will dynamically choose the appropriate type of challenge from a list of possible actions. For more information, refer to Cloudflare Challenges.
- JavaScript Challenge: Presents the Under Attack mode interstitial page to visitors. The visitor or client must support JavaScript. Useful for blocking DDoS attacks with minimal impact to legitimate visitors.
- Interactive Challenge: Requires the visitor to complete an interactive challenge before visiting your site. Prevents bots from accessing the site.

## Email Address Obfuscation

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/email-address-obfuscation/)

Page options # Email Address Obfuscation

By enabling Cloudflare Email Address Obfuscation, email addresses on your web page will be hidden from bots, while keeping them visible to humans. In fact, there are no visible changes to your website for visitors.

## Background

Email harvesters and other bots roam the Internet looking for email addresses to add to lists that target recipients for spam. This trend results in an increasing amount of unwanted email.

Web administrators have come up with clever ways to protect against this by writing out email addresses, such as help [at] cloudflare [dot] com or by using embedded images of the email address. However, you lose the convenience of clicking on the email address to automatically send an email. By enabling Cloudflare Email Address Obfuscation, email addresses on your web page will be obfuscated (hidden) from bots, while keeping them visible to humans. In fact, there are no visible changes to your website for visitors.

## How it works

When Email Address Obfuscation is enabled, Cloudflare replaces visible email addresses in your HTML with links like [email¬†protected]. If a visitor sees this obfuscated format, they can click the link to reveal the actual email address. This approach prevents bots from scraping email addresses while keeping them accessible to real users.

## Change Email Address Obfuscation setting

Cloudflare enables email address obfuscation automatically when you sign up.

- Dashboard
- API

To disable Email Address Obfuscation in the dashboard:

1. Log into the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó.
2. Select your account and website.
3. Go to Scrape Shield.
4. For Email Address Obfuscation, switch the toggle to Off.

To disable Email Address Obfuscation with the API, send a PATCH request with email_obfuscation as the setting name in the URI path, and the value parameter set to "off".

Note

To use this feature on specific hostnames - instead of across your entire zone - use a configuration rule.

## Prevent Cloudflare from obfuscating email

To prevent Cloudflare from obfuscating specific email addresses, you can:

- Add the following comment in the page HTML code:
<!--email_off-->contact@example.com<!--/email_off-->
- Return email addresses in JSON format for AJAX calls, making sure your web server returns a content type of application/json.
- Disable the Email Obfuscation feature by creating a configuration rule to be applied on a specific endpoint.

## Troubleshoot email obfuscation

To prevent unexpected website behavior, email addresses are not obfuscated when they appear in:

- Any HTML tag attribute, except for the href attribute of the a tag.
- Other HTML tags:

script tags: <script></script>
noscript tags: <noscript></noscript>
textarea tags: <textarea></textarea>
xmp tags: <xmp></xmp>
head tags: <head></head>
- script tags: <script></script>
- noscript tags: <noscript></noscript>
- textarea tags: <textarea></textarea>
- xmp tags: <xmp></xmp>
- head tags: <head></head>
- Any page that does not have a MIME type of text/html or application/xhtml+xml.

Note

Email Obfuscation will not apply in the following cases:

- You are using the Cache-Control: no-transform header.
- The HTML/JS code is specifically added by a Worker.

## Hotlink Protection

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/hotlink-protection/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/scrape-shield/hotlink-protection/)

Page options # Hotlink Protection

Hotlink Protection prevents your images from being used by other sites, which can reduce the bandwidth consumed by your origin server ‚Üó.

Note

The supported file extensions are gif, ico, jpg, jpeg, and png.

## Background

When Cloudflare receives an image request for your site, we check to ensure the request did not originate from visitors on another site. Visitors to your domain will still be able to download and view images.

Technically, this means that Hotlink Protection denies access to requests when the HTTP referer
does not include your website domain name (and is not blank).

Hotlink protection has no impact on crawling, but it will prevent the images from being displayed on sites such as Google images, Pinterest, and Facebook.

## Enable Hotlink Protection

- Dashboard
- API

To enable Hotlink Protection in the dashboard:

1. Log into the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó.
2. Select your account and website.
3. Go to Scrape Shield.
4. For Hotlink Protection, switch the toggle to On.

To enable Hotlink Protection with the API, send a PATCH request with hotlink_protection as the setting name in the URI path, and the value parameter set to "on".

Note

To use this feature on specific hostnames - instead of across your entire zone - use a configuration rule.

### SaaS providers using Cloudflare

If you are a SaaS provider using Cloudflare for SaaS, note that, by default, Hotlink Protection will only allow requests with your zone as referer. To avoid blocking requests from your customers (custom hostnames), consider using Configuration Rules or custom rules.

## Allow hotlinking to specific images

You may want certain images to be hotlinked to, whether by external websites (like Google) or certain situations like when using an RSS feed.

### Configuration rules

To disable Hotlink Protection selectively, create a configuration rule covering the path of an image folder.

### hotlink-ok directory

You can allow certain images to be hotlinked by placing them in a directory named hotlink-ok. The hotlink-ok directory can be placed anywhere on your website.

To allow another website to use logo.png from example.com, put logo.png in a new folder called hotlink-ok.

Some examples of URLs that will not be checked for hotlinking:

- http://example.com/hotlink-ok/pic.jpg
- http://example.com/images/hotlink-ok/pic.jpg
- http://example.com/hotlink-ok/images/pic.jpg
- http://example.com/images/main-site/hotlink-ok/pic.jpg

## User Agent Blocking

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/user-agent-blocking/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/user-agent-blocking/)

Page options # User Agent Blocking

User Agent Blocking allows you to block specific browser or web application User-Agent request headers ‚Üó. User agent rules apply to the entire domain instead of individual subdomains.

User agent rules are applied after zone lockdown rules. If you allow an IP address via Zone Lockdown, it will skip any user agent rules.

Note

Cloudflare recommends that you use custom rules instead of user agent rules to block specific user agents.

For example, a custom rule equivalent to the user agent example rule provided in this page could have the following configuration:

- Expression: http.user_agent eq "BadBot/1.0.2 (+http://bad.bot)"
- Action: (a block or challenge action)

## Availability

Cloudflare User Agent Blocking is available on all plans. However, this feature is only available in the new security dashboard if you have configured at least one user agent rule.

The number of available user agent rules depends on your Cloudflare plan.

## Zone Lockdown

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/zone-lockdown/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/zone-lockdown/)

Page options # Zone Lockdown

Zone Lockdown specifies a list of one or more IP addresses, CIDR ranges, or networks that are the only IPs allowed to access a domain, subdomain, or URL. You can configure multiple destinations, including IPv4/IPv6 addresses, in a single zone lockdown rule.

All IP addresses not specified in the zone lockdown rule will not have access to the specified resources. Requests from those IP addresses will receive an Access Denied response.

Note

Cloudflare recommends that you create custom rules instead of zone lockdown rules to block requests from IP addresses not present in an allowlist of IPs and CIDR ranges.

For example, a custom rule equivalent to the zone lockdown example rule provided in this page could have the following configuration:

- Description: Block all traffic to staging and wiki unless it comes from HQ or branch offices
- Expression: ((http.host eq "staging.example.com") or (http.host eq "example.com" and starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/wiki/")) and not ip.src in {192.0.2.0/24 2001:DB8::/64 203.0.133.1}
- Action: Block

## Availability

Cloudflare Zone Lockdown is available on paid plans. However, this feature is only available in the new security dashboard if you have configured at least one zone lockdown rule.

The number of available zone lockdown rules depends on your Cloudflare plan.

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/browser-integrity-check/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/browser-integrity-check/)

Page options # Browser Integrity Check

Cloudflare's Browser Integrity Check (BIC) looks for common HTTP headers abused most commonly by spammers and denies access to your page.

It also challenges visitors without a user agent or with a non-standard user agent such as commonly used by abusive bots, crawlers, or visitors.

Browser Integrity Check is enabled by default.

## Disable Browser Integrity Check

### Disable globally

To disable BIC globally for your zone:

- Old dashboard
- New dashboard

1. Log into the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó.
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to Security > Settings.
4. Turn off Browser Integrity Check.

1. Log into the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó.
2. Select your account and zone.
3. Go to Security > Settings and filter by DDoS attacks.
4. Turn off Browser integrity check.

### Disable selectively

To disable BIC selectively, you can skip Browser Integrity Check using a custom rule with a skip action.

## Privacy Pass

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/privacy-pass/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/privacy-pass/)

Page options # Privacy Pass

Privacy Pass ‚Üó specifies an extensible protocol for creating and redeeming anonymous and transferable tokens. Its specification is maintained by the IETF.
Cloudflare provides "Silk - Privacy Pass Client". This is a Chrome and Firefox browser extension used for research, which provides a better visitor experience for Cloudflare-protected websites. Privacy Pass is especially helpful for visitors from shared networks, VPNs, and Tor that tend to have poorer IP reputations.

For instance, a visitor IP address with poor reputation may receive a Cloudflare challenge page before gaining access to a Cloudflare-protected website.¬†Privacy Pass allows the visitor to solve a challenge with or without interaction, depending on the device. Solving this challenge is coordinated with a third party attester in such a way that Cloudflare does not see the attestation method or the interaction, preserving visitors' privacy while maintaining a high level of security.

## Set up Privacy Pass

### For your end users

Your end users should download the Privacy Pass extension for either Google Chrome or Firefox:

- Chrome extension ‚Üó
- Firefox extension ‚Üó

The Privacy Pass code is available on¬†GitHub ‚Üó. You can report any issues in this repository.

## Support for Privacy Pass v1 (legacy)

In 2017 Cloudflare announced support ‚Üó for Privacy Pass, a recent protocol to let users prove their identity across multiple sites anonymously without enabling tracking. The initial use case was to provide untraceable tokens to sites to vouch for users who might otherwise have been presented with a CAPTCHA challenge. In the time since this release, Privacy Pass has evolved both at the IETF ‚Üó and within Cloudflare. The version announced in 2017 is now considered legacy, and these legacy Privacy Pass tokens are no longer supported as an alternative to Cloudflare challenges. As has been discussed on our blog The end road for CAPTCHA ‚Üó, Cloudflare uses a variety of signals to infer if incoming traffic is likely automated. The (legacy) Privacy Pass zone setting is no longer meaningful to Cloudflare customers as Cloudflare now operates CAPTCHA free ‚Üó, and supports the latest Privacy Pass draft ‚Üó.

In September 2023, Cloudflare removed support for Privacy Pass v1 (legacy) tokens as an alternative to Cloudflare managed challenges, and in March 2024 the current public-facing API was removed.

The full deprecation notice for the first version of Privacy Pass is available on the API deprecations page.

## Replace insecure JS libraries

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/replace-insecure-js-libraries/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/replace-insecure-js-libraries/)

Page options # Replace insecure JS libraries

This feature, when turned on, automatically rewrites URLs to external JavaScript libraries to point to Cloudflare-hosted libraries instead. This change improves security and performance, and reduces the risk of malicious code being injected.

This rewrite operation currently supports the polyfill JavaScript library hosted in polyfill.io.

Warning

You may need to update your Content Security Policy (CSP) when turning on Replace insecure JavaScript libraries. The feature, when enabled, will not perform any URL rewrites if a CSP is present with a script-src or default-src directive. Cloudflare will not check report-only directives and it will not modify CSP headers.

Additionally, if you are defining a CSP via HTML meta tag, you must either turn off this feature or switch to a CSP defined in an HTTP header.

## How it works

When turned on, Cloudflare will check HTTP(S) proxied traffic for script tags with an src attribute pointing to a potentially insecure service and replace the src value with the equivalent link hosted under cdnjs ‚Üó.

The rewritten URL will keep the original URL scheme (http:// or https://).

For polyfill.io URL rewrites, all 3.* versions of the polyfill library are supported under the /v3 path. Additionally, the /v2 path is also supported. If an unknown version is requested under the /v3 path, Cloudflare will rewrite the URL to use the latest 3.* version of the library (currently 3.111.0).

## Availability

The feature is available in all Cloudflare plans, and is turned on by default on Free plans.

## Configure

- Dashboard
- API

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó and select your account and zone.
2. Go to Security > Settings.
3. Turn Replace insecure JavaScript libraries on or off.

Issue a PATCH request similar to the following:

Terminal window ```
curl --request PATCH \"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/settings/replace_insecure_js" \--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \--header "Content-Type: application/json" \--data '{ "value": "on" }'
```

## Final remarks

Since pages.dev zones are on a Free plan, the Replace insecure JavaScript libraries feature is turned on by default on these zones and it is not possible to turn it off.

## Security Level

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/security-level/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/security-level/)

Page options # Security Level

In the old Cloudflare dashboard, security level has the value Always protected and you cannot change this setting. To turn Under Attack mode on or off, use the separate toggle.

In the new security dashboard, the Cloudflare API, and in Terraform, use security level to turn Under Attack mode on or off.

Cloudflare's Under Attack mode performs additional security checks to help mitigate layer 7 DDoS attacks. When you enable Under Attack mode, Cloudflare will present a JS challenge page.

Warning

Only use Under Attack mode when a website is under a DDoS attack. Under Attack mode may affect some actions on your domain, such as your API traffic.

To enable or disable Under Attack mode for your API or any other part of your domain, create a configuration rule.

## Threat score

Previously, a threat score represented a Cloudflare threat score from 0‚Äì100, where 0 indicates low risk. Now, the threat score is always 0 (zero).

Recommendation

Currently we do not recommend creating rules based on the threat score, since this score is no longer being populated.

## Validation checks

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/validation-checks/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/validation-checks/)

Page options # Validation checks

Cloudflare performs a validation check for every request. The Validation component executes prior to all other security features like custom rules or Managed Rules. The validation check blocks malformed requests like Shellshock attacks and requests with certain attack patterns in their HTTP headers before any allowlist logic occurs.

Note

Currently, you cannot disable validation checks. They run early in Cloudflare's infrastructure before the configuration for domains has been loaded.

## Event logs for validation checks

Actions performed by the Validation component appear in Sampled logs in Security Events, associated with the Validation service and without a rule ID. Event logs downloaded from the API show source as Validation and action as drop when this behavior occurs.

The following example shows a request blocked by the Validation component due to a malformed User-Agent HTTP request header:

In the downloaded JSON file for the event, the ruleId value indicates the detected issue ‚Äî in this case, it was a Shellshock attack.

```
{  "action": "drop",  "ruleId": "sanity-shellshock",  "source": "sanitycheck",  "userAgent": "() { :;}; printf \\\\\"detection[%s]string\\\\\" \\\\\"TjcLLwVzBtLzvbN\\\\"  //...}

## Work with custom rulesets in the dashboard

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/create-dashboard/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/create-dashboard/)

Page options # Work with custom rulesets in the dashboard

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

Custom rulesets are configured at the account level.

## Create and deploy a custom ruleset

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the WAF page.
  Go to WAF
2. Go to the Custom rulesets tab.
3. To create a new empty ruleset, select Create ruleset. To duplicate an existing ruleset, select the three dots next to it > Duplicate.
4. In the page that displays, enter a name and (optionally) a description for the custom ruleset.
5. Under Scope, define when the custom ruleset should run.

Select All incoming requests to apply the custom ruleset to all incoming requests for all your zones on an Enterprise plan.
Select Custom filter expression to define a custom expression that defines when to execute the custom ruleset. Use the Field drop-down list to choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for Field is compared to the value you specify for Value using the operator selected in Operator. Alternatively, select Edit expression to define your expression using the Expression Editor.

WarningDeployed custom rulesets will only apply to incoming traffic of Enterprise domains. The Expression Builder will automatically include this filter. If you define a custom expression for the ruleset using the Expression Editor, you must use parentheses to enclose any custom conditions and end your expression with and cf.zone.plan eq "ENT" so that the rule only applies to domains on an Enterprise plan.
6. Select All incoming requests to apply the custom ruleset to all incoming requests for all your zones on an Enterprise plan.
7. Select Custom filter expression to define a custom expression that defines when to execute the custom ruleset. Use the Field drop-down list to choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for Field is compared to the value you specify for Value using the operator selected in Operator.

## Create a custom ruleset using the API

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/create-api/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/custom-rulesets/create-api/)

Page options # Create a custom ruleset using the API

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

To deploy custom rules at the account level, you must create a custom ruleset with one or more rules. Use the Rulesets API to work with custom rulesets using the API.

If you are using Terraform, refer to WAF custom rules configuration using Terraform.

## Procedure

To deploy a custom ruleset in your account, follow these general steps:

1. Create a custom ruleset in the http_request_firewall_custom phase with one or more rules.
2. Deploy the ruleset to the entry point ruleset of the http_request_firewall_custom phase at the account level.

Currently, you can only deploy WAF custom rulesets at the account level.

### 1. Create a custom ruleset

The following example creates a custom ruleset with a single rule in the rules array.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following token permissions is required: - Account WAF Write
- Account Rulesets Write

Create an account ruleset ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "description": "",    "kind": "custom",    "name": "My custom ruleset",    "rules": [        {            "description": "Challenge web traffic (not /api)",            "expression": "not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, \"/api/\")",            "action": "managed_challenge"        }    ],    "phase": "http_request_firewall_custom"  }'
```

Save the ruleset ID in the response for the next step.

### 2. Deploy the custom ruleset

To deploy the custom ruleset, add a rule with "action": "execute" to the http_request_firewall_custom phase entry point ruleset at the account level.

1. Invoke the Get an account entry point ruleset operation to obtain the definition of the entry point ruleset for the http_request_firewall_custom phase. You will need the account ID for this task.

## Rate limiting rulesets

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/rate-limiting-rulesets/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/rate-limiting-rulesets/)

Page options # Rate limiting rulesets

A rate limiting rule defines a rate limit for requests matching an expression, and the action to perform when that rate limit is reached. At the account level, rate limiting rules are always grouped into rate limiting rulesets, which you then deploy.

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

To apply a rate limiting ruleset at the account level, create a custom rate limiting ruleset with one or more rate limiting rules and then deploy it to one or more zones on an Enterprise plan.

## Next steps

For instructions on creating and deploying a rate limiting ruleset, refer to the following pages:

- Create a rate limiting ruleset in the dashboard
- Create a rate limiting ruleset using the API

For Terraform examples, refer to Rate limiting rules configuration using Terraform.

## Create a rate limiting ruleset in the dashboard

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/rate-limiting-rulesets/create-dashboard/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/rate-limiting-rulesets/create-dashboard/)

Page options # Create a rate limiting ruleset in the dashboard

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

At the account level, rate limiting rules are grouped into rate limiting rulesets. You must first create a custom ruleset with one or more rate limiting rules, and then deploy it to one or more zones on an Enterprise plan.

## 1. Create a custom rate limiting ruleset

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the WAF page.
  Go to WAF
2. Go to the Rate limiting rulesets tab.
3. To create a new empty ruleset, select Create ruleset. To duplicate an existing ruleset, select the three dots next to it > Duplicate.
4. Enter a name for the ruleset and (optionally) a description.
5. In the ruleset creation page, select Create rule.
6. In the rule creation page, enter a descriptive name for the rule in Rule name.
7. Under When incoming requests match, use the Field drop-down list to choose an HTTP property. For each request, the value of the property you choose for Field is compared to the value you specify for Value using the operator selected in Operator.
8. (Optional) Under Cache status, disable Also apply rate limiting to cached assets to consider only the requests that reach the origin when determining the rate.
9. Under With the same characteristics, configure the characteristics that will define the request counters for rate limiting purposes. Each value combination will have its own counter to determine the rate. Refer to How Cloudflare determines the request rate for more information.
The available characteristics depend on your Cloudflare plan and product subscriptions.
10. (Optional) To define an expression that specifies the conditions for incrementing the rate counter, enable Use custom counting expression and set the expression. By default, the counting expression is the same as the rule expression. The counting expression can include response fields.
11. Under When rate exceeds, define the maximum number of requests and the time period to consider when determining the rate.
12. Under Then take action, select the rule action from the Choose an action drop-down list. For example, selecting Block tells Cloudflare to refuse requests in the conditions you specified when the request limit is reached.
13. (Optional) If you selected the Block action, you can configure a custom response for requests exceeding the configured rate limit.
14. Select the mitigation timeout in the Duration dropdown. This is the time period during which Cloudflare applies the select action once the rate is reached.
Enterprise customers with a paid add-on can throttle requests instead of applying the configured action for a selected duration. To throttle requests, under With the following behavior select Throttle requests over the maximum configured rate.
15. Select Add rule.
16. Create additional rate limiting rules as needed, and then select Create to create the ruleset.

## 2. Deploy the custom rate limiting ruleset

To deploy a custom rate limiting ruleset to one or more zones on an Enterprise plan:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the WAF page.
  Go to WAF
2. Go to the Rate limiting rulesets tab.
3. Under Your custom rate limiting rulesets and next to the rate limiting ruleset you wish to deploy, select Deploy.
4. In the ruleset deployment page, enter a descriptive name for the rule deploying the ruleset in Execution name.
5. Under Execution scope, review the scope of the rate limiting ruleset to deploy. If necessary, select Edit scope and configure the expression that will determine the scope of the current rule.
WarningDeployed custom rate limiting rulesets will only apply to incoming traffic of zones on an Enterprise plan. The Expression Builder will automatically include this filter. If you define a custom expression using the Expression Editor, you must include AND zone.level eq "ENT" in your expression so that the rule only applies to zones on an Enterprise plan.
6. To deploy your rule immediately, select Deploy. If you are not ready to deploy your rule, select Save as Draft.

The Deployed custom rate limiting rulesets list will show a rule for each deployed custom rate limiting ruleset.

## Configure a custom response for blocked requests

When you select the Block action in a rule you can optionally define a custom response.

The custom response has three settings:

- With response type: Choose a content type or the default rate limiting response from the list. The available custom response types are the following:

























Dashboard valueAPI valueCustom HTML"text/html"Custom Text"text/plain"Custom JSON"application/json"Custom XML"text/xml"
- With response code: Choose an HTTP status code for the response, in the range 400-499. The default response code is 429.
- Response body: The body of the response. Configure a valid body according to the response type you selected. The maximum field size is 30 KB.

## Create a rate limiting ruleset via API

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/rate-limiting-rulesets/create-api/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/rate-limiting-rulesets/create-api/)

Page options # Create a rate limiting ruleset via API

To deploy rate limiting rules at the account level, you must create a rate limiting ruleset with one or more rules. Use the Rulesets API to create and deploy rate limiting rulesets via API.

Note

At the API level, a rate limiting ruleset is a regular custom ruleset with one or more rate limiting rules that you create in the http_ratelimit phase. The concept of custom rate limiting ruleset exists in the Cloudflare dashboard to make it clear that you are configuring and deploying rate limiting rules at the account level. This page with API instructions uses the same terminology.

Each rate limiting rule contains a ratelimit object with the rate limiting configuration. Refer to Rate limiting parameters for more information on this object and its parameters.

If you are using Terraform, refer to Rate limiting rules configuration using Terraform.

## Procedure

To deploy a rate limiting ruleset in your account, follow these general steps:

1. Create a rate limiting ruleset (that is, a custom ruleset in the http_ratelimit phase) with one or more rate limiting rules.
2. Deploy the ruleset to the entry point ruleset of the http_ratelimit phase at the account level.

### 1. Create a rate limiting ruleset

The following example creates a rate limiting ruleset with a single rate limiting rule in the rules array.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following token permissions is required: - Account WAF Write
- Account Rulesets Write

Create an account ruleset ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "description": "",    "kind": "custom",    "name": "My rate limiting ruleset",    "rules": [        {            "description": "Rate limit API requests",            "expression": "(starts_with(http.request.uri.path, \"/my-api/\"))",            "ratelimit": {                "characteristics": [                    "ip.src",                    "cf.colo.id"                ],                "requests_to_origin": false,                "requests_per_period": 30,                "period": 60,                "mitigation_timeout": 120            },            "action": "block",            "action_parameters": {                "response": {                    "status_code": 429,                    "content_type": "application/json",                    "content": "{ \"error\": \"Your API requests have been rate limited. Wait a couple of minutes and try again.\" }"                }            },            "enabled": true        }    ],    "phase": "http_ratelimit"  }'
```

The available characteristics depend on your Cloudflare plan and product subscriptions. Refer to Availability for more information.

Save the ruleset ID in the response for the next step.

### 2. Deploy the rate limiting ruleset

To deploy the rate limiting ruleset, add a rule with "action": "execute" to the http_ratelimit phase entry point ruleset at the account level.

1. Invoke the Get an account entry point ruleset operation to obtain the definition of the entry point ruleset for the http_ratelimit phase. You will need the account ID for this task.

6. If the entry point ruleset already exists (that is, if you received a 200 OK status code and the ruleset definition), take note of the ruleset ID in the response. Then, invoke the Create an account ruleset rule operation to add an execute rule to the existing ruleset deploying the rate limiting ruleset. By default, the rule will be added at the end of the list of rules already in the ruleset.
The following request creates a rule that executes the rate limiting ruleset with ID <RATE_LIMITING_RULESET_ID> for all Enterprise zones in the account:

## Managed rulesets

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/managed-rulesets/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/managed-rulesets/)

Page options # Managed rulesets

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

Cloudflare provides pre-configured managed rulesets that protect against web application exploits such as the following:

- Zero-day vulnerabilities
- Top-10 attack techniques
- Use of stolen/leaked credentials
- Extraction of sensitive data

Managed rulesets are regularly updated. Each rule has a default action that varies according to the severity of the rule. You can adjust the behavior of specific rules, choosing from several possible actions.

Rules of managed rulesets have associated tags (such as wordpress) that allow you to search for a specific group of rules and configure them in bulk.

## Account-level deployment

At the account level, you can deploy each WAF managed ruleset more than once. This means that you can apply the same managed ruleset with different configurations to different subsets of incoming traffic for the Enterprise zones in your account.

For example, you could deploy the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset multiple times with different paranoia levels and a different action (Managed Challenge action for PL3 and Log action for PL4).

Example: Deploy OWASP with two different configurations

The following example deploys the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset multiple times at the account level through the following execute rules:

- First execute rule: Enable OWASP rules up to paranoia level 3 (PL3) and set the action to Managed Challenge.
- Second execute rule: Enable OWASP rules up to PL4 and set the action to Log.

This configuration gives you additional protection by enabling PL3 rules, but without blocking the requests, since higher paranoia levels are more prone to false positives.

The second rule logs any matches for PL4 rules, the most strict set of rules in the ruleset, so that it does not affect live traffic. You could use this configuration to understand which traffic would be affected by PL4 rules.

- Dashboard
- API

1. Deploy the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset by following the dashboard instructions, customizing the ruleset behavior using these settings:

OWASP Anomaly Score Threshold: Medium - 40 and higher
OWASP Paranoia Level: PL3
OWASP Action: Managed Challenge
2. OWASP Anomaly Score Threshold: Medium - 40 and higher
3. OWASP Paranoia Level: PL3
4. OWASP Action: Managed Challenge
5. Select Deploy.
6. Repeat the deployment procedure for the OWASP ruleset, but with following ruleset configuration:

OWASP Anomaly Score Threshold: Medium - 40 and higher
OWASP Paranoia Level: PL4
OWASP Action: Log
7. OWASP Anomaly Score Threshold: Medium - 40 and higher
8. OWASP Paranoia Level: PL4
9. OWASP Action: Log

Once you finish your configuration, the Deployed managed rulesets list will show two Execute rules for the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset.

The following POST request for the Create an account ruleset operation creates an entry point ruleset for the http_request_firewall_managed phase at the account level. The ruleset includes two rules deploying the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset twice with different configurations.

Required API token permissions

At least one of the following token permissions is required: - Account WAF Write
- Account Rulesets Write

Create an account ruleset ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "name": "My ruleset",    "description": "Entry point ruleset for WAF managed rulesets (account)",    "kind": "root",    "phase": "http_request_firewall_managed",    "rules": [        {            "action": "execute",            "action_parameters": {                "id": "4814384a9e5d4991b9815dcfc25d2f1f",                "overrides": {                    "categories": [                        {                            "category": "paranoia-level-4",                            "enabled": false                        }                    ],                    "rules": [                        {                            "id": "6179ae15870a4bb7b2d480d4843b323c",                            "action": "managed_challenge"                        }                    ]                }            },            "expression": "cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\"",            "description": "Execute OWASP ruleset at PL3 with Managed Challenge action"        },        {            "action": "execute",            "action_parameters": {                "id": "4814384a9e5d4991b9815dcfc25d2f1f",                "overrides": {                    "rules": [                        {                            "id": "6179ae15870a4bb7b2d480d4843b323c",                            "action": "log"                        }                    ]                }            },            "expression": "cf.zone.plan eq \"ENT\"",            "description": "Execute OWASP ruleset at PL4 with Log action"        }    ]  }'
```

## Customize the behavior of managed rulesets

To customize the behavior of managed rulesets, do one of the following:

- Create exceptions to skip the execution of managed rulesets or some of their rules under certain conditions.
- Configure overrides to change the rule action
or disable one or more rules of managed rulesets. Overrides can affect an
entire managed ruleset, specific tags, or specific rules in the managed
ruleset.

Exceptions have priority over overrides.

Important

Ruleset overrides and tag overrides apply to both existing and future rules in the managed ruleset. If you want to override existing rules only, you must use rule overrides.

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-dashboard/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-dashboard/)

Page options # Deploy a WAF managed ruleset in the dashboard (account)

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

To deploy a managed ruleset for a single zone, refer to Deploy a managed ruleset in the dashboard for a zone.

## Deploy a managed ruleset

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the WAF page.
  Go to WAF
2. Go to the Managed rulesets tab.
3. Select Deploy > Deploy managed ruleset.
4. Next to the managed ruleset you want to deploy, select Select ruleset.
5. Give a name to the rule deploying the ruleset in Execution name.
6. (Optional) To execute the managed ruleset for a subset of incoming requests, select Edit scope and configure the expression that will determine the scope of the current rule deploying the managed ruleset.
WarningDeployed rulesets will only apply to incoming traffic of Enterprise domains on your account. The Expression Builder will automatically include this filter. If you define a custom expression using the Expression Editor, use parentheses to enclose any custom conditions and end your expression with and cf.zone.plan eq "ENT" so that the rule only applies to domains on an Enterprise plan.
7. (Optional) You can customize the behavior of the managed ruleset in the following ways:

Configure the entire ruleset (affects all the rules)
Configure several rules or rules with specific tags
Configure a single rule
8. Configure the entire ruleset (affects all the rules)
9. Configure several rules or rules with specific tags
10. Configure a single rule
11. To deploy the managed ruleset immediately, select Deploy. If you are not ready to deploy, select Save as Draft.

The Deployed managed rulesets list will show an Execute rule for the managed ruleset you deployed.

## Turn on or off a managed ruleset

Select the Enabled toggle next to a deployed managed ruleset to turn it on or off.

## Configure a managed ruleset

Configure a managed ruleset to define specific field values for one or more rules (for example, configure a rule with an action different from the action configured by Cloudflare). You can also turn off specific rules.

To skip one or more rules ‚Äî or even entire WAF managed rulesets ‚Äî for specific incoming requests, add an exception. Exceptions, also called skip rules, are shown as Skip rules in the Deployed managed rulesets list.

Note

Some managed rulesets may not allow custom configuration, depending on your Cloudflare plan.

### Configure field values for all the rules

To configure an entire managed ruleset:

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the WAF page.
  Go to WAF
2. Go to the Managed rulesets tab.
3. Select the rule description of the Execute rule that deploys the managed ruleset you want to configure. Alternatively, select the three dots > Edit.
If you have not deployed the managed ruleset yet, do the following:

Select Deploy > Deploy managed ruleset.
Next to the managed ruleset you want to deploy and configure, select Select ruleset.
4. Select Deploy > Deploy managed ruleset.
5. Next to the managed ruleset you want to deploy and configure, select Select ruleset.
6. In the ruleset configuration section, set one or more rule fields from the available values in the drop-down lists. The exact options vary according to the managed ruleset you are configuring.
For example, select the action to perform for all the rules in the ruleset from the Ruleset action drop-down list.
7. If you are editing a deployed managed ruleset, select Save. If you have not deployed the managed ruleset yet, select Deploy to deploy the ruleset immediately, or Save as Draft to save your deployment settings for later.

### Configure rules in bulk in a managed ruleset

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the WAF page.
  Go to WAF
2. Go to the Managed rulesets tab.
3. If you have already deployed the managed ruleset you want to configure, find the rule deploying that managed ruleset and select the rule description. Alternatively, select the three dots > Edit next to an Execute rule deploying the managed ruleset.
If you have not deployed the managed ruleset:

Select Deploy > Deploy managed ruleset.
Next to the managed ruleset, select Select ruleset.
4. Select Deploy > Deploy managed ruleset.
5. Next to the managed ruleset, select Select ruleset.
6. Select Browse rules.

1. Search for rules using the available filters. You can search for tags.
2. In the results list, select the checkboxes for all the rules you want to configure.
Alternatively, select a tag name under the search input to filter the rules with that tag, and then select the checkboxes for the rules you want to configure. To extend your selection to all rules with the tag across all pages, select Select all <NUMBER> rules.
3. Update one or more fields for the selected rules using the buttons displayed in the top right corner of the table.
4. Select Next.
5. If you selected a tag, a dialog appears asking you if any new rules with the selected tag should be configured with the field values you selected.

Select Do not apply to new rules to apply your configurations to the selected rules only.
Select Apply to new rules if you want to apply your configurations to any new rules with the select tag.
6. Select Do not apply to new rules to apply your configurations to the selected rules only.
7. Select Apply to new rules if you want to apply your configurations to any new rules with the select tag.
8. Select Save.

### Configure a single rule in a managed ruleset

1. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the WAF page.
  Go to WAF
2. Go to the Managed rulesets tab.
3. If you have already deployed the managed ruleset you want to configure, find the rule deploying that managed ruleset and select the rule description. Alternatively, select the three dots > Edit next to an Execute rule deploying the managed ruleset.
If you have not deployed the managed ruleset:

Select Deploy > Deploy managed ruleset.
Next to the managed ruleset, select Select ruleset.
4. Select Deploy > Deploy managed ruleset.
5. Next to the managed ruleset, select Select ruleset.

## Deploy a WAF managed ruleset via API (account)

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-api/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/account/managed-rulesets/deploy-api/)

Page options # Deploy a WAF managed ruleset via API (account)

Note

This feature requires an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

Use the Rulesets API to deploy a WAF managed ruleset to the http_request_firewall_managed phase at the account level.

The WAF Managed Rules page includes the IDs of the different WAF managed rulesets. You will need this information when deploying rulesets via API.

If you are using Terraform, refer to WAF Managed Rules configuration using Terraform.

## Example

The following example deploys the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset to the http_request_firewall_managed phase of a given account ($ACCOUNT_ID) by creating a rule that executes the managed ruleset. The rules in the managed ruleset are executed when the zone name matches one of example.com or anotherexample.com.

1. Invoke the Get an account entry point ruleset operation to obtain the definition of the entry point ruleset for the http_request_firewall_managed phase. You will need the account ID for this task.
 Required API token permissions
 
At least one of the following token permissions 
is required:
Account WAF WriteAccount WAF ReadAccount Rulesets ReadAccount Rulesets Write Get an account entry point rulesetcurl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint" \  --request GET \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"
{  "result": {    "description": "Account-level phase entry point",    "id": "<RULESET_ID>",    "kind": "root",    "last_updated": "2024-03-16T15:40:08.202335Z",    "name": "root",    "phase": "http_request_firewall_managed",    "rules": [      // ...    ],    "source": "firewall_managed",    "version": "10"  },  "success": true,  "errors": [],  "messages": []}
2. Account WAF Write
3. Account WAF Read
4. Account Rulesets Read
5. Account Rulesets Write
6. If the entry point ruleset already exists (that is, if you received a 200 OK status code and the ruleset definition), take note of the ruleset ID in the response. Then, invoke the Create an account ruleset rule operation to add an execute rule to the existing ruleset deploying the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset (with ID efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee). By default, the rule will be added at the end of the list of rules already in the ruleset.

8. Account Rulesets Write
9. If the entry point ruleset does not exist (that is, if you received a 404 Not Found status code in step 1), create it using the Create an account ruleset operation. Include a single rule in the rules array that executes the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset (with ID efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee) for all incoming requests where the zone name matches one of example.com or anotherexample.com.

10. Account WAF Write
11. Account Rulesets Write

## Next steps

To customize the behavior of the rules included in a managed ruleset, create an override.

To skip the execution of WAF managed rulesets or some of their rules, create an exception (also called a skip rule).

Exceptions have priority over overrides.

## Alerts

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/alerts/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/alerts/)

Page options # Alerts

Cloudflare provides two types of security alerts that inform you of any spikes in security events:

- Security Events Alert: Alerts about spikes across all services that generate log entries in Security Events.
- Advanced Security Events Alert: Similar to Security Events Alert with support for additional filtering options.

For details on alert types and their availability, refer to Alert types.

To receive security alerts, you must configure a notification. Notifications help you stay up to date with your Cloudflare account through email, PagerDuty, or webhooks, depending on your Cloudflare plan.

## Set up a notification for security alerts

For instructions on how to set up a notification for a security alert, refer to Create a Notification.

## Alert logic

Security alerts use a static threshold together with a z-score ‚Üó calculation over the last six hours and five-minute buckets of events. An alert is triggered whenever the z-score value is above 3.5 and the spike crosses a threshold of 200 security events. You will not receive duplicate alerts within the same two-hour time frame.

## Alert types

Advanced Security Events Alert

Who is it for? 

Enterprise customers who want to receive alerts about spikes in specific services that generate log entries in Security Events. For more information, refer to WAF alerts.



Other options / filters 

A mandatory filters selection is needed when you create a notification policy which includes the list of services and zones that you want to be alerted on.

- You can search for and add domains from your list of Enterprise zones.
- You can choose which services the alert should monitor (Managed Firewall, Rate Limiting, etc.).
- You can filter events by a targeted action.



Included with 

Enterprise plans.



What should you do if you receive one? 

Review the information in Security Events to identify any possible attack or misconfiguration.



Additional information 

The mean time to detection is five minutes.

When setting up this alert, you can select the services that will be monitored. Each selected service is monitored separately and can be selected as a filter.



Limitations 

Security Events (WAF) alerts are not sent for each individual events, but only when a spike in traffic reaches the threshold for an alert to be sent.

These thresholds cannot be configured. Z-score is used to determine the threshold.

## Phases

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/phases/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/phases/)

Page options # Phases

The Web Application Firewall provides the following phases where you can create rulesets and rules:

- http_request_firewall_custom
- http_ratelimit
- http_request_firewall_managed

These phases exist both at the account level and at the zone level. Considering the available phases and the two different levels, rules will be evaluated in the following order:

- Old dashboard
- New dashboard

| Security feature | Scope | Phase | Ruleset kind | Location in the dashboard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Custom rulesets | Account | http_request_firewall_custom | custom (create)root (deploy) | Go to WAF     > Custom rulesets tab |
| Custom rules | Zone | http_request_firewall_custom | zone | Your zone > Security > WAF > Custom rules tab |
| Rate limiting rulesets | Account | http_ratelimit | root | Go to WAF     > Rate limiting rulesets tab |
| Rate limiting rules | Zone | http_ratelimit | zone | Your zone > Security > WAF > Rate limiting rules tab |
| Managed rulesets | Account | http_request_firewall_managed | root | Go to WAF     > Managed rulesets tab |
| Managed rules | Zone | http_request_firewall_managed | zone | Your zone > Security > WAF > Managed rules tab |

| Security feature | Scope | Phase | Ruleset kind | Location in the dashboard |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Custom rulesets | Account | http_request_firewall_custom | custom (create)root (deploy) | Go to WAF     > Custom rulesets tab |
| Custom rules | Zone | http_request_firewall_custom | zone | Your zone > Security > Security rules |
| Rate limiting rulesets | Account | http_ratelimit | root | Go to WAF     > Rate limiting rulesets tab |
| Rate limiting rules | Zone | http_ratelimit | zone | Your zone > Security > Security rules |
| Managed rulesets | Account | http_request_firewall_managed | root | Go to WAF     > Managed rulesets tab |
| Managed rules | Zone | http_request_firewall_managed | zone | Your zone > Security > Security rules |

## WAF managed rules (previous version)

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/)

Page options # WAF managed rules (previous version)

Managed rules, a feature of Cloudflare WAF (Web Application Firewall), identifies and removes suspicious activity for HTTP GET and POST requests.

Warning

- This page contains documentation about the previous implementation of WAF Managed Rules. For more information on the new version, refer to WAF Managed Rules.
- All customers with access to the previous version of WAF managed rules can upgrade to the new version.
- The new WAF Managed Rules provide the Cloudflare Free Managed Ruleset to all customers, including customers on a Free plan. Refer to the announcement blog post ‚Üó for details.

Examples of malicious content ‚Üó that managed rules identify include:

- Common keywords used in comment spam (XX, Rolex, Viagra, etc.)
- Cross-site scripting attacks (XSS)
- SQL injections (SQLi)

WAF managed rules (previous version) are available to Pro, Business, and Enterprise plans for any subdomains proxied to Cloudflare. Control managed rules settings in Security > WAF > Managed rules.

Managed rules includes three packages:

- Cloudflare Managed Ruleset
- OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set
- Customer requested rules

You can use the sampled logs in the Security Events dashboard to review threats blocked by WAF managed rules.

## Cloudflare Managed Ruleset

The Cloudflare Managed Ruleset contains security rules written and curated by Cloudflare. Select a ruleset name under Group to reveal the rule descriptions.

Cloudflare Specials is a group that provides core firewall security against common attacks ‚Üó.

Note

Cloudflare recommends that you always leave Cloudflare Specials enabled. Additionally, only enable rule groups that correspond to your technology stack. For example, if you use WordPress, enable the Cloudflare WordPress group.

When viewing a ruleset, Cloudflare shows default actions for each rule listed under Default mode. The Mode available for individual rules within a specific Cloudflare Managed Ruleset are:

- Default: Takes the default action listed under Default mode when viewing a specific rule.
- Disable: Turns off the specific rule within the group.
- Block: Discards the request.
- Interactive Challenge: The visitor receives a challenge page that requires interaction.
- Simulate: The request is allowed through but is logged in sampled logs.

Cloudflare's WAF changelog allows customers to monitor ongoing changes to the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset.

## OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set package assigns a score to each request based on how many OWASP rules trigger. Some OWASP rules have a higher sensitivity score than others.

After OWASP evaluates a request, Cloudflare compares the final score to the Sensitivity configured for the zone.¬† If the score exceeds the sensitivity, the request is actioned based on the Action configured within Package: OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set:

- Block: The request is discarded.
- Challenge: The visitor receives an interactive challenge page.
- Simulate: The request is allowed through but is logged in sampled logs.

The sensitivity score required to trigger the WAF for a specific Sensitivity is as follows:

- Low: 60 and higher
- Medium: 40 and higher
- High: 25 and higher

For AJAX requests, the following scores are applied instead:

- Low: 120 and higher
- Medium: 80 and higher
- High: 65 and higher

Review the entry in sampled logs for the final score and for the individual triggered rules.

### Control the OWASP package

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set package contains several rules from the OWASP project ‚Üó. Cloudflare does not write or curate OWASP rules. Unlike the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset, specific OWASP rules are either turned On or Off.

To manage OWASP thresholds, set the Sensitivity to Low, Medium, or High under Package: OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set.

Setting the Sensitivity to Off will disable the entire OWASP package including all its rules. Determining the appropriate Sensitivity depends on your business industry and operations. For instance, a Low setting is appropriate for:

- Certain business industries more likely to trigger the WAF.
- Large file uploads.

With a high sensitivity, large file uploads will trigger the WAF.

Cloudflare recommends initially setting the sensitivity to Low and reviewing for false positives before further increasing the sensitivity.

Note

Sampled logs displays rule ID 981176 when a request is blocked by OWASP. Also, some OWASP rules listed in Sampled logs do not appear in the OWASP list of rules because disabling those rules is not recommended.

## Important remarks

- Managed rules introduce a limited amount of latency.
- Changes to WAF managed rules take about 30 seconds to update globally.
- Cloudflare uses proprietary rules to filter traffic.
- Established Websockets do not trigger managed rules for subsequent requests.
- Managed rules parse JSON responses to identify vulnerabilities targeted at APIs. JSON payload parsing is limited to 128 KB.
- Managed rules mitigate padding techniques. Cloudflare recommends the following:


Turn on rule with ID 100048. This rule protects against padding type attacks, but it is not deployed by default because there is a high probability of causing false positives in customer environments. It is, however, important that customers tune their managed rules configuration.


Create a WAF custom rule using the Expression Editor depending on the need to check headers and/or body to block larger payloads (> 128 KB). Use the following fields for this purpose:

http.request.body.truncated
http.request.headers.truncated

You should test your rule in Log mode first (if available), since the rule might generate false positives.
- Turn on rule with ID 100048. This rule protects against padding type attacks, but it is not deployed by default because there is a high probability of causing false positives in customer environments. It is, however, important that customers tune their managed rules configuration.
- Create a WAF custom rule using the Expression Editor depending on the need to check headers and/or body to block larger payloads (> 128 KB). Use the following fields for this purpose:

http.request.body.truncated
http.request.headers.truncated

You should test your rule in Log mode first (if available), since the rule might generate false positives.
- http.request.body.truncated
- http.request.headers.truncated
- There are a handful of managed rules that Cloudflare does not disable even if you turn off Managed rules in the Cloudflare dashboard, such as rules with IDs WP0025B, 100043A, and 100030.

## Troubleshooting

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/troubleshooting/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/troubleshooting/)

Page options # Troubleshooting

By default, WAF managed rules are fully managed via the Cloudflare dashboard and are compatible with most websites and web applications. However, false positives and false negatives may occur:

- False positives: Legitimate requests detected and filtered as malicious.
- False negatives: Malicious requests not filtered.

## Troubleshoot false positives

The definition of suspicious content is subjective for each website. For example, PHP code posted to your website is normally suspicious. However, your website may be teaching how to code and it may require PHP code submissions from visitors. In this situation, you should disable related managed rules for this website, since they would interfere with normal website operation.

To test for false positives, set WAF managed rules to Simulate mode. This mode allows you to record the response to possible attacks without challenging or blocking incoming requests. Also, review the Security Events' sampled logs to determine which managed rules caused false positives.

If you find a false positive, there are several potential resolutions:

- Add the client‚Äôs IP addresses to the IP Access Rules allowlist: If the browser or client visits from the same IP addresses, allowing is recommended.
- Disable the corresponding managed rule(s): Stops blocking or challenging false positives, but reduces overall site security. A request blocked by Rule ID 981176 refers to OWASP rules. Decrease OWASP sensitivity to resolve the issue.
- Bypass WAF managed rules with a firewall rule (deprecated): Create a firewall rule with the Bypass action to deactivate WAF managed rules for a specific combination of parameters. For example, bypass managed rules for a specific URL and a specific IP address or user agent.
- (Not recommended) Disable WAF managed rules for traffic to a URL: Lowers security on the particular URL endpoint. Configured via Page Rules.

Additional guidelines are as follows:

- If one specific rule causes false positives, set rule‚Äôs Mode to Disable rather than turning Off the entire rule Group.
- For false positives with the administrator section of your website, create a page rule to Disable Security for the admin section of your site resources ‚Äî for example, example.com/admin.

## Troubleshoot false negatives

To identify false negatives, review the HTTP logs on your origin web server. To reduce false negatives, use the following checklist:

- Are WAF managed rules enabled in Security > WAF > Managed rules?
- Are WAF managed rules being disabled via Page Rules?
- Not all managed rules are enabled by default, so review individual managed rule default actions.

For example, Cloudflare allows requests with empty user agents by default. To block requests with an empty user agent, change the rule Mode to Block.
Another example: if you are looking to block unmitigated SQL injection attacks, make sure the relevant SQLi rules are enabled and set to Block under the Cloudflare Specials group.
- For example, Cloudflare allows requests with empty user agents by default. To block requests with an empty user agent, change the rule Mode to Block.
- Another example: if you are looking to block unmitigated SQL injection attacks, make sure the relevant SQLi rules are enabled and set to Block under the Cloudflare Specials group.
- Are DNS records that serve HTTP traffic proxied through Cloudflare?
- Is a firewall rule bypassing managed rules?
- Does an allowed country, ASN, IP range, or IP address in IP Access rules or firewall rules match the attack traffic?
- Is the malicious traffic reaching your origin IP addresses directly to bypass Cloudflare protection? Block all traffic except from Cloudflare's IP addresses at your origin web server.

## WAF managed rules upgrade

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/upgrade/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-waf-managed-rules/upgrade/)

Page options # WAF managed rules upgrade

On 2022-05-04, Cloudflare started the upgrade from the previous version of WAF managed rules to the new WAF Managed Rules, allowing a first set of eligible zones to migrate. Currently, all zones can upgrade to WAF Managed Rules, including partner accounts.

Cloudflare is gradually upgrading all zones to the new version of WAF Managed Rules. You can also start the upgrade process manually for a zone in the Cloudflare dashboard or via API. The upgrade is irreversible ‚Äî once you upgrade to the new WAF Managed Rules, you cannot go back to the previous version.

If you are using the old dashboard, once the upgrade finishes your rules will be shown using a different user interface in Security > WAF > Managed rules tab. If you are using the new security dashboard, your upgraded rules will be shown in Security > Security rules.

Additionally, the WAF managed rules APIs will stop working once you upgrade.

Deprecation notice

The APIs and Terraform resources related to the previous version of WAF managed rules are deprecated. The APIs for managing the previous version of WAF managed rules are no longer supported since 2025-06-15. The same applies to Terraform resources related to the previous version of WAF managed rules. You must migrate your configuration to avoid any issues.

Refer to Possible upgrade errors if you are having issues upgrading.

## Main benefits

The new version of WAF Managed Rules provides the following benefits over the previous version:

- New matching engine ‚Äì WAF Managed Rules are powered by the Ruleset Engine, which allows faster managed rule deployments and the ability to check even more traffic without scaling issues. The rules follow the same syntax used in other Cloudflare security products like WAF custom rules.
- Updated Managed Rulesets ‚Äì The Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset, one of WAF's Managed Rulesets, is based on the latest version of the OWASP Core Ruleset (v3.x), which adds paranoia levels and improves false positives rates compared to the version used in WAF managed rules (2.x). You also have more control over the sensitivity score, with a clear indication of how much each rule contributes to the score and what was the total score of a triggered request.
- Better rule browsing and configuration ‚Äì Deploy Managed Rulesets with a single click to get immediate protection. Override the behavior of entire rulesets, or customize a single rule. Apply overrides to all rules with a specific tag to adjust rules applicable to a given software or attack vector. You can deploy configurations like the following:

Deploy the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset across all my zones.
Deploy the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset on all traffic that does not contain /api/* in the path.
Disable Managed Rulesets across my account for traffic coming from my IP.
- Deploy the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset across all my zones.
- Deploy the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset on all traffic that does not contain /api/* in the path.
- Disable Managed Rulesets across my account for traffic coming from my IP.

For more information on the benefits of WAF Managed Rules, refer to our blog post ‚Üó.

## Upgrade impact

You will be able to upgrade all your zones that do not have URI-based WAF overrides. The same protection will apply to your zone once you move to the new WAF.

Most configuration settings from the previous version of WAF managed rules will be upgraded to the new version, but some specific configurations originally defined in the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set will be lost ‚Äî you will have to create these configurations in the new WAF Managed Rules, if needed.

For API users, the APIs for managing the previous version of WAF managed rules will stop working once you upgrade. You must use the Rulesets API to manage the new WAF Managed Rules.

### Configurations that will be upgraded

The upgrade process will create an equivalent configuration for the following settings of WAF managed rules:

- Firewall rules configured with Bypass > WAF Managed Rules.
- Page Rules configured with Disable Security.
- Page Rules configured with Web Application Firewall: Off or Web Application Firewall: On.

The OWASP ruleset configuration will be partially upgraded. Refer to the next section for details.

### Configurations that will be lost in the upgrade process

The upgrade process will partially migrate the settings of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set available in the previous version of WAF managed rules.

The following OWASP settings will be migrated:

- Sensitivity: The old sensitivity values will be migrated to the following paranoia level (PL) and score threshold combinations in the new OWASP ruleset:






























Old sensitivityPL in new OWASPScore threshold in new OWASPHighPL2Medium ‚Äì 40 or higherMediumPL1High ‚Äì 25 or higherLowPL1Medium ‚Äì 40 or higherDefaultPL2Medium ‚Äì 40 or higher
- Action: The action in the previous OWASP ruleset has an almost direct mapping in the new OWASP managed ruleset, except for the Simulate action which will be migrated to Log.

The following OWASP settings will not be migrated, since there is no direct equivalence between rules in the two versions:

- OWASP group overrides
- OWASP rule overrides

To replace these settings you will need to configure the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset in WAF Managed Rules again according to your needs, namely any tag/rule overrides. For more information on configuring the new OWASP Core Ruleset, refer to Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset.

### Configurations that will prevent you from upgrading

If a zone has URI-based WAF overrides (only available via API), you will not have the option to upgrade to WAF Managed Rules. To upgrade to WAF Managed Rules you must:

1. Delete any existing URI-based WAF overrides using the Delete a WAF override operation.
2. Follow the upgrade process described below.

### Cloudflare dashboard changes

After the upgrade process is complete, the Cloudflare dashboard will display your rules in:

- Old dashboard: Security > WAF > Managed rules tab (using a different user interface)
- New dashboard: Security > Security rules

Unlike the old WAF managed rules, there is no longer a global on/off setting to enable the WAF. Instead, you deploy each managed ruleset individually in your zone.

For more information about deploying WAF Managed Rules in the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to Deploy a WAF managed ruleset in the dashboard.

### API changes

Once the upgrade is complete, the APIs for interacting with WAF managed rules will stop working. These APIs are the following:

- WAF packages
- WAF rule groups
- WAF rules

Warning

If you have any integrations using the WAF managed rules APIs stated above, you must update them before upgrading to the new WAF Managed Rules.

To work with WAF Managed Rules you must use the Rulesets API. For more information on deploying WAF Managed Rules via API, refer to Deploy managed rulesets via API.

### Terraform changes

Once the upgrade is complete, the following Terraform resources for configuring WAF managed rules will stop working:

- cloudflare_waf_package ‚Üó
- cloudflare_waf_group ‚Üó
- cloudflare_waf_rule ‚Üó

These resources were only supported in the Terraform Cloudflare provider up to version 3.35. Version 4.x no longer supports these resources ‚Üó.

To manage the configuration of the new WAF Managed Rules using Terraform, you must use cloudflare_ruleset ‚Üó resources.

## Eligible zones

### Phase 2 (since 2022-09-19)

Update notice

On 2023-08-18, Cloudflare added support for upgrading partner accounts to the new WAF Managed Rules.

In phase 2 all zones are eligible for upgrade. The exact upgrade procedure varies according to your Cloudflare plan.

- Pro and Business customers can upgrade to the new WAF Managed Rules in the Cloudflare dashboard or via API. Once the new version is enabled, the previous version of WAF managed rules will be automatically disabled.
- Enterprise customers can enable the new WAF Managed Rules configuration while keeping the previous version of WAF managed rules enabled, allowing them to check the impact of the new WAF configuration. After reviewing the behavior of the new configuration and making any required adjustments to specific managed rules, Enterprise users can then finish the upgrade, which will disable the previous version of WAF managed rules.

Note: Zones that have URI-based WAF overrides, which you could only manage via API, will not be able to upgrade immediately to the new WAF Managed Rules. You must delete these overrides before migrating.

### Phase 1 (since 2022-05-04)

In phase 1 the upgrade became available to a subset of eligible zones, which had to meet the following requirements:

- The zone has:

WAF disabled, or
WAF enabled and only the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset is enabled (the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set must be disabled).
- WAF disabled, or
- WAF enabled and only the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset is enabled (the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set must be disabled).
- The zone has no firewall rules or Page Rules bypassing, enabling, or disabling WAF managed rules:

Firewall rules configured with Bypass > WAF Managed Rules.
Page Rules configured with Disable Security.
Page Rules configured with Web Application Firewall: Off or Web Application Firewall: On.
- Firewall rules configured with Bypass > WAF Managed Rules.
- Page Rules configured with Disable Security.
- Page Rules configured with Web Application Firewall: Off or Web Application Firewall: On.
- The zone has no URI-based WAF overrides (only available via API).

## Start the upgrade

You can start the WAF upgrade in the Cloudflare dashboard or via API.

### Using the dashboard

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and zone.
2. If you are using the old dashboard, go to Security > WAF > Managed rules tab.
If you are using the new security dashboard, go to Security > Security rules instead and select Go to upgrade your Managed rules.
If you are an Enterprise customer, the dashboard will show the following banner:

If you are a Professional/Business customer, the dashboard will show the following banner:
3. In the upgrade banner, select Review configuration. This banner is only displayed in eligible zones.
4. Review the proposed WAF configuration. You can adjust configuration, like editing the WAF Managed Rules configuration or creating exceptions to skip the execution of rulesets or specific rules.
5. When you are done reviewing, select Deploy to deploy the new WAF Managed Rules configuration.
If you are a Professional/Business customer, Cloudflare will deploy the new WAF configuration and then disable the previous WAF version. The upgrade process may take a couple of minutes.
If you are an Enterprise customer, both WAF implementations will be enabled simultaneously when you select Deploy, so that you can validate your new configuration. Refer to the steps in the next section for additional guidance.

#### Validate your new WAF configuration and finish the upgrade (Enterprise customers only)

If you are an Enterprise customer, after deploying your new WAF configuration both WAF implementations will be enabled simultaneously. During this stage (called validation mode), you can access both implementations of WAF Managed Rules in the Cloudflare dashboard, which will keep showing the upgrade banner until you finish upgrading. The new WAF Managed Rules will run before the previous version.

1. Use the current validation mode to check the behavior of the new WAF configuration in Security Events. For more information, refer to Analyzing the new WAF behavior in Security Events.
2. When you are done reviewing your configuration with both WAFs enabled, select Ready to update in the upgrade banner, and then select Turn off previous version. This operation will complete the upgrade and disable the previous WAF version.

When the upgrade finishes, the dashboard will show all of your upgraded rules in:

- Old dashboard: Security > WAF > Managed rules tab
- New dashboard: Security > Security rules

To check if the upgrade has finished, refresh the dashboard.

Note

The upgrade process can take up to an hour. During this period you may observe security events from both versions of WAF managed rules.

### Using the API

1. Use the Check WAF update compatibility operation to determine if the zone can update to the new WAF, given its current configuration:
Terminal windowcurl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/waf_migration/check?phase_two=1" \--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
Example response:
{  "result": {    "compatible": true,    "migration_state": "start"  },  "success": true,  "errors": [],  "messages": []}
If the response includes "compatible": true, this means that the zone can update to the new WAF and you can proceed with the upgrade process. If the response includes "compatible": false, this means that your zone is not eligible for the upgrade, given its current configuration. Refer to Eligible zones for details.
2. To get the new WAF configuration corresponding to your current configuration, use the Get new WAF configuration operation:
Terminal windowcurl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/waf_migration/config?phase_two=1" \--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>"
Example response:
{  "result": {    "name": "default",    "rules": [      {        "id": "",        "version": "",        "action": "execute",        "expression": "true",        "description": "",        "ref": "",        "enabled": true,        "action_parameters": {          "id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",          "overrides": {            "rules": [              {                "id": "23ee7cebe6e8443e99ecf932ab579455",                "action": "log",                "enabled": false              }            ]          }        }      }    ]  },  "success": true,  "errors": [],  "messages": []}

The returned configuration in the example above, which would match the existing configuration for the previous WAF version, contains:

- A rule that executes the Cloudflare Managed Ruleset (ruleset ID efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee).
- A single override for the rule Apache Struts - Open Redirect - CVE:CVE-2013-2248 (rule ID 23ee7cebe6e8443e99ecf932ab579455) in the same ruleset, setting the action to log and disabling the rule.

1. (Optional, for Enterprise customers only) If you are upgrading an Enterprise zone to WAF Managed Rules, you can enter validation mode before finishing the upgrade. In this mode, both WAF implementations will be enabled. Use the Update a zone entry point ruleset operation, making sure you include the waf_migration=validation&phase_two=1 query string parameters:
Terminal windowcurl --request PUT \"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint?waf_migration=validation&phase_two=1" \--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \--header "Content-Type: application/json" \--data '{  "name": "default",  "rules": [    {      "action": "execute",      "expression": "true",      "description": "",      "enabled": true,      "action_parameters": {        "id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",        "overrides": {          "rules": [            {              "id": "23ee7cebe6e8443e99ecf932ab579455",              "action": "log",              "enabled": false            }          ]        }      }    }  ]}'
After invoking this API endpoint, both WAF managed rules and WAF Managed Rules will be enabled. Check sampled logs in Security Events for any legitimate traffic getting blocked, and perform any required adjustments to the WAF Managed Rules configuration. For example, you can add an override for a single rule that disables it or changes its action.
2. To finish the upgrade and disable WAF managed rules, set the configuration for the new WAF using the settings you obtained in step 2 and possibly adjusted in step 3. Make sure you include the waf_migration=pending&phase_two=1 query string parameters.
Terminal windowcurl --request PUT \"https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/{zone_id}/rulesets/phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint?waf_migration=pending&phase_two=1" \--header "Authorization: Bearer <API_TOKEN>" \--header "Content-Type: application/json" \--data '{  "name": "default",  "rules": [    {      "id": "",      "version": "",      "action": "execute",      "expression": "true",      "description": "",      "ref": "",      "enabled": true,      "action_parameters": {        "id": "efb7b8c949ac4650a09736fc376e9aee",        "overrides": {          "rules": [            {              "id": "23ee7cebe6e8443e99ecf932ab579455",              "action": "log",              "enabled": false            }          ]        }      }    }  ]}'

Once the provided configuration is saved and the new WAF Managed Rules are enabled, the previous version of the WAF managed rules will be automatically disabled, due to the presence of the waf_migration=pending&phase_two=1 parameters. This will make sure that your zone stays protected by one of the WAF versions during the update process.

Note

Pro and Business customers, which do not have access to the validation mode described in step 3, can update the rules (and overrides) in their zone entry point ruleset without triggering the upgrade by omitting the waf_migration=pending&phase_two=1 parameters. However, all the rules in their configuration must be disabled ("enabled": false). Only Enterprise customers can configure (enabled) rules deploying Managed Rulesets without triggering the upgrade.

## Analyzing the new WAF behavior in Security Events

### For Enterprise customers

If you are an Enterprise customer, use the validation mode of the WAF upgrade process to check the behavior of the new WAF Managed Rules configuration. Cloudflare enables validation mode after you deploy the new WAF configuration. In this mode, the previous WAF version is still enabled, so that you can validate the behavior of your new configuration during the upgrade process. The new WAF Managed Rules will run before the previous version.

Go to sampled logs in Security Events during validation mode and check the following:

- Look for any requests allowed by the new WAF that are being handled by the previous WAF version (for example, by a challenge or block action). If this happens, consider writing a firewall rule or a WAF custom rule to handle the requests you previously identified.
- Look for legitimate requests being blocked by the new WAF. In this situation, edit the WAF managed rule that is blocking these requests, changing the performed action or disabling the rule. For more information, refer to Configure a managed ruleset.

### For Business/Professional customers

Business and Professional customers do not have access to validation mode, which means that they will be able to check the new WAF behavior after they upgrade to the new WAF Managed Rules.

In the days following the upgrade, check sampled logs in Security Events looking for any legitimate requests being blocked by WAF Managed Rules. If you identify any incorrectly blocked requests, adjust the corresponding WAF rule action to Log. For more information on changing the action of a managed ruleset rule, refer to Configure a single rule in a managed ruleset.

Additionally, check for requests that should have been blocked. In this situation, consider creating a firewall rule or a WAF custom rule to block these requests.

## API operations

Upgrading to the new WAF Managed Rules via API requires invoking the following API operations:

| Name | Method + Endpoint | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Check WAFupdate compatibility | GET /zones/<ZONE_ID>/waf_migration/check?phase_two=1 | Checks if the current zone can be updated to the new WAF, given its current configuration. |
| Get new WAFconfiguration | GET /zones/<ZONE_ID>/waf_migration/config?phase_two=1 | Obtains the new WAF Managed Rules configuration that is equivalent to the current configuration (previous version of WAF managed rules). |
| Update zoneentry point ruleset | PUT /zones/<ZONE_ID>/rulesets/ phases/http_request_firewall_managed/entrypoint?waf_migration=<VALUE>&phase_two=1 | Updates the configuration of the zone entry point ruleset for the http_request_firewall_managed phase.Available values for the waf_migration query string parameter:‚Äì pending / 1: Defines the new WAF Managed Rules configuration and disables the previous version of WAF managed rules as soon as the provided configuration is saved and the new WAF is enabled.‚Äì validation / 2: (Enterprise zones only) Defines the new WAF Managed Rules configuration and enables the new WAF Managed Rules side by side with the previous version, entering validation mode. To exit validation mode and finish the upgrade, invoke the same API endpoint with waf_migration=pending. |
| Get WAF status | GET /zones/<ZONE_ID>/waf_migration/status | Obtains the status of old and new WAF managed rules for a zone (enabled/disabled). The response also includes the current upgrade state (or mode). |

You must prepend the Cloudflare API base URL to the endpoints listed above to obtain the full endpoint:

https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4

## Possible upgrade errors

Contact Cloudflare Support to get help with the following errors:

- The number of firewall rules to migrate exceeds 200.
- The length of a firewall rule expression is longer than 4 KB.

## Additional resources

### Configuring the new WAF Managed Rules using the Cloudflare API

Instead of using the previous APIs for managing WAF packages, rule groups, and rules, you must now use the Rulesets API to programmatically configure WAF Managed Rules.

You can also create overrides to specify changes to be executed on top of the default WAF Managed Rules configuration. These changes will take precedence over the managed ruleset‚Äôs default behavior.

For more information, refer to the following resources:

- Deploy a managed ruleset to a phase at the zone level
- Override a managed ruleset

### Configuring the new WAF Managed Rules using Terraform

Instead of using the previous resources for managing WAF packages, rule groups, and rules, you must now use the cloudflare_ruleset ‚Üó Terraform resource to configure WAF Managed Rules. For configuration examples, refer to WAF Managed Rules configuration using Terraform.

#### Replace your configuration using cf-terraforming

You can use the cf-terraforming ‚Üó tool to generate the Terraform configuration for your new WAF Managed Rules configuration after you upgrade. Then, import the new resources to Terraform state.

The recommended steps for replacing your old WAF managed rules configuration in Terraform with a new ruleset-based configuration for the new WAF Managed Rules are the following:

1. Run the following command to generate all ruleset configurations for a zone:
Terminal windowcf-terraforming generate --zone <ZONE_ID> --resource-type "cloudflare_ruleset"
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31" {  kind    = "zone"  name    = "default"  phase   = "http_request_firewall_managed"  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  rules {    [...]  }  [...]}[...]
2. The previous command may return additional ruleset configurations for other Cloudflare products also based on the Ruleset Engine. Since you are looking for the WAF Managed Rules configuration, keep only the Terraform resource for the http_request_firewall_managed phase and save it to a .tf configuration file. You will need the full resource name in the next step.
3. Import the cloudflare_ruleset resource you previously identified into Terraform state using the terraform import command. For example:
Terminal windowterraform import cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31 zone/<ZONE_ID>/3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31
 cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Importing from ID "zone/<ZONE_ID>/3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31"... cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Import prepared!   Prepared cloudflare_ruleset for import cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Refreshing state... [id=3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31]
 Import successful!
 The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now in your Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
4. Run terraform plan to validate that Terraform now checks the state of the new cloudflare_ruleset resource, in addition to other existing resources already managed by Terraform. For example:
Terminal windowterraform plan
cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Refreshing state... [id=3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31][...]cloudflare_waf_package.my_package: Refreshing state... [id=14a2524fd75c419f8d273116815b6349]cloudflare_waf_group.my_group: Refreshing state... [id=0580eb5d92e344ddb2374979f74c3ddf][...]
5. Remove any state related to the previous version of WAF managed rules from your Terraform state:
WarningYou must remove WAF packages, groups, and rules from Terraform state before deleting their configuration from .tf configuration files to prevent issues.


Run the following command to find all resources related to the previous version of WAF managed rules:
Terminal windowterraform state list | grep -E '^cloudflare_waf_(package|group|rule)\.'
cloudflare_waf_package.my_packagecloudflare_waf_group.my_group


Run the terraform state rm ... command in dry-run mode to understand the impact of removing those resources without performing any changes:
Terminal windowterraform state rm -dry-run cloudflare_waf_package.my_package cloudflare_waf_group.my_group
Would remove cloudflare_waf_package.my_packageWould remove cloudflare_waf_group.my_group


If the impact looks correct, run the same command without the -dry-run parameter to actually remove the resources from Terraform state:
Terminal windowterraform state rm cloudflare_waf_package.my_package cloudflare_waf_group.my_group
Removed cloudflare_waf_package.my_packageRemoved cloudflare_waf_group.my_groupSuccessfully removed 2 resource instance(s).
6. Run the following command to find all resources related to the previous version of WAF managed rules:
Terminal windowterraform state list | grep -E '^cloudflare_waf_(package|group|rule)\.'
cloudflare_waf_package.my_packagecloudflare_waf_group.my_group
7. Run the terraform state rm ... command in dry-run mode to understand the impact of removing those resources without performing any changes:
Terminal windowterraform state rm -dry-run cloudflare_waf_package.my_package cloudflare_waf_group.my_group
Would remove cloudflare_waf_package.my_packageWould remove cloudflare_waf_group.my_group
8. If the impact looks correct, run the same command without the -dry-run parameter to actually remove the resources from Terraform state:
Terminal windowterraform state rm cloudflare_waf_package.my_package cloudflare_waf_group.my_group

## Final remarks

The concept of paranoia level did not exist in the OWASP version (2.x) used in WAF managed rules. Based on the OWASP guide recommendations, the WAF migration process will set the paranoia level of the Cloudflare OWASP Core Ruleset to PL2.

You cannot disable the new version of WAF Managed Rules using Page Rules, since the Web Application Firewall: Off setting in Page Rules only applies to the previous version of WAF managed rules. To disable the new WAF Managed Rules you must configure exceptions (also known as skip rules).

## Rate Limiting (previous version)

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/)

Page options # Rate Limiting (previous version)

Cloudflare Rate Limiting automatically identifies and mitigates excessive request rates for specific URLs or for an entire domain.

Warning

The information in this page refers to the previous version of rate limiting rules, which are billed based on usage.

Cloudflare is upgrading all rate limiting rules to the new version of rate limiting rules. For more information on what changed in the new version, refer to the upgrade guide.

Request rates are calculated locally for individual Cloudflare data centers. The most common uses for Rate Limiting are:

- Protect against DDoS attacks ‚Üó
- Protect against Brute-force attack ‚Üó
- Limit access to forum searches, API calls, or resources that involve database-intensive operations at your origin

Once an individual IPv4 address or IPv6 /64 IP range exceeds a rule threshold, further requests to the origin server are blocked with an HTTP 429 response status code. The response includes a Retry-After header to indicate when the client can resume sending requests.

Note

Are you trying to enable Rate Limiting? Enable Rate Limiting ‚Üó.

### Rate limiting and SEO

Cached resources and known Search Engine crawlers are exempted from your rate limiting rules (previous version only). Therefore, they do not affect your website's SEO ranking.

## Availability

Note

Cloudflare Rate Limiting (previous version) is an add-on service for all customer plans, available in Security > WAF > Rate limiting rules.

The number of allowed rate limiting rules depends on the domain's plan:

| Plan | Rules | Rules matching response headers | Actions | Action Duration | Request Period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free | 1 | 1 | Block | 1 minute or 1 hour | 10 seconds or 1 minute |
| Pro | 10 | 1 | Block, Interactive Challenge, JS Challenge, Managed Challenge, or Log | 1 minute or 1 hour | 10 seconds or 1 minute |
| Business | 15 | 10 | Block, Interactive Challenge, JS Challenge, Managed Challenge, or Log | 1 minute, 1 hour, or 24 hours | 10 seconds, 1 minute, or 10 minutes |
| Enterprise | 100 | 10 | Block, Interactive Challenge, JS Challenge, Managed Challenge, or Log | Any duration entered between 10 seconds and 86,400 seconds (24 hours) | Any value entered between 10 seconds and 3,600 seconds (1 hour) |

Cloudflare Rate Limiting supports multiple levels of configuration control depending on the domain‚Äôs Cloudflare plan. The table below maps out what you can do based on your plan:

| Order | Task | Available in |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Configure a basic rate limiting rule | All plans |
| 2 | Configure Advanced Criteria | Business and Enterprise plans |
| 3 | Configure Advanced Response | Business and Enterprise plans |
| 4 | Configure the Bypass option | Enterprise plan |

## Components of a rate limiting rule

A rate limiting rule consists of three distinct components:

- Request matching criteria
- Rate matching criteria
- Rule mitigation

### Request matching criteria

Incoming requests are matched based on request path, request scheme, request method, and (optionally) origin response code.

#### Request path

For example:

- http://example.com/example
- http://example.com/example/*

The request path is case insensitive. Patterns cannot match content after query strings (?) or anchors (#). An asterisk (*) matches any sequence of characters, including an empty sequence. For example:

- *.example.com/* matches any path on any subdomain of example.com.
- *example.com/example.html matches example.html on example.com or any subdomain of example.com.
- * matches any page on your site.

A request for example.com/path is not the same as example.com/path/. The only exception to this rule is the homepage: example.com matches example.com/.

#### Request scheme

HTTP or HTTPS. If none is specified, both are matched, and the rule will list __ALL__.

#### Request method

POST or GET. If none is specified, all methods are matched, and the rule will list __ALL__.

#### (Optional) Origin response code

For example, match a rate limiting rule only when the origin server returns an HTTP 401 or 403 status code. A triggered rule matching the response code criteria blocks subsequent requests from that client regardless of origin response code.

### Rate matching criteria

A rule can match on the number and time period of all requests coming from the same client.

#### Number of requests

Specify a minimum of two requests. For single request blocking, make the path unavailable ‚Äî for example, configure your origin server to return an HTTP 403 status code.

#### Request period

A rule triggers once a client‚Äôs requests exceed the threshold for the specified duration.

### Rule mitigation

Rule mitigations consist of mitigation action and ban duration.

#### Mitigation action

Rate limit actions are based on the domain plan as mentioned in Availability:

- Block: Cloudflare issues an HTTP 429 error when the threshold is exceeded.
- JS Challenge: Visitor must pass a Cloudflare JavaScript Challenge. If passed, Cloudflare allows the request.
- Managed Challenge (recommended): Visitor must pass a challenge dynamically chosen by Cloudflare based on the characteristics of the request. If passed, Cloudflare allows the request.
- Interactive Challenge: Visitor must pass an Interactive Challenge. If passed, Cloudflare allows the request.
- Log: Requests are logged in Cloudflare Logs. This helps test rules before applying to production.

For more information on challenge actions, refer to Cloudflare challenges.

#### Ban duration

Setting a timeout shorter than the threshold causes the API to automatically increase the timeout to equal the threshold.

Visitors hitting a rate limit receive a default HTML page if a custom error page is not specified. In addition, Business and Enterprise customers can specify a response in the rule itself. Refer to Configure Advanced Response for details.

## Identify rate-limit thresholds

To identify a general threshold for Cloudflare Rate Limiting, divide 24 hours of uncached website requests by the unique visitors for the same 24 hours. Then, divide by the estimated average minutes of a visit. Finally, multiply by 4 (or larger) to establish an estimated threshold per minute for your website. A value higher than 4 is fine since most attacks are an order of magnitude above typical traffic rates.

To identify URL rate limits for specific URLs, use 24 hours of uncached requests and unique visitors for the specific URL. Adjust thresholds based on user reports and your own monitoring.

## Task 1: Configure a basic rate limiting rule

The following sections cover two common types of rate limiting rules.

### Enable Protect your login

Rate Limiting features a one-click Protect your login tool that creates a rule to block the client for 15 minutes when sending more than 5 POST requests within 5 minutes. This is sufficient to block most brute-force attempts.

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > WAF > Rate limiting rules.
3. Under Rate Limiting, select Protect your login.
4. Enter Rule Name and Enter your login URL in the Protect your login dialog that appears.
5. Select Save.
6. The Rule Name appears in your Rate Limiting rules list.

### Create a custom rate limiting rule

1. Log in to the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Üó, and select your account and domain.
2. Go to Security > WAF > Rate limiting rules.
3. Select Create rate limiting rule. A dialog opens where you specify the details of your new rule.
4. Enter a descriptive name for the rule in Rule Name.
5. For If Traffic Matching the URL, select an HTTP scheme from the dropdown and enter a URL.
6. In from the same IP address exceeds, enter an integer greater than 1 to represent the number of requests in a sampling period.
7. For requests per, select the sampling period (the period during which requests are counted). Domains on Enterprise plans can enter manually any duration between 10 seconds and 3,600 seconds (one hour).
8. For Then, pick one of the available actions based on your plan. Review the Rule mitigation section for details.
9. If you selected Block or Log, for matching traffic from that visitor for, select how long to apply the option once a threshold has been triggered. Domains on Enterprise plans can enter any value between 10 seconds and 86,400 seconds (24 hours).
10. To activate your new rule, select Save and Deploy.

The new rule appears in the rate limiting rules list.

Note

Any change to a rate limiting rule clears that rule's currently triggered actions. Take care when editing rate limiting rules to mitigate an ongoing attack.

In general, when setting a lower threshold:

1. Leave existing rules in place and add a new rule with the lower threshold.
2. Once the new rule is in place, wait for the action duration of the old rule to pass before deleting the old rule.

When setting a higher threshold (due to legitimate client blocking), increase the threshold within the existing rule.

## Task 2: Configure Advanced Criteria (only Business and Enterprise plans)

The Advanced Criteria option configures which HTTP methods, header responses, and origin response codes to match for your rate limiting rule.

To configure your advanced criteria for a new or existing rule:

1. Expand Advanced Criteria.
2. Select a value from Method(s). The default value is ANY, which matches all HTTP methods.
3. Filter by HTTP Response Header(s). Select Add header response field to include headers returned by your origin web server.
The CF-Cache-Status header appears by default so that Cloudflare serves cached resources rather than rate limit those resources. To also rate limit cached resources, remove this header by selecting X or enable Also apply rate limit to cached assets.
If you have more than one header under HTTP Response Header(s), an AND boolean logic applies. To exclude a header, use the Not Equals option. Each header is case insensitive.
4. Under Origin Response code(s), enter the numerical value of each HTTP response code to match. Separate two or more HTTP codes with a comma (for example: 401, 403).
5. (Optional) Configure additional rate limiting features, based on your plan.
6. Select Save and Deploy.

## Task 3: Configure Advanced Response (only Business and Enterprise plans)

The Advanced Response option configures the information format returned by Cloudflare when a rule's threshold is exceeded. Use Advanced Response when you wish to return static plain text or JSON content.

To configure a plain text or JSON response:

1. Expand Advanced Response.
2. Select a Response type format other than the default: Custom JSON or Custom TEXT.
3. Enter the plain text or JSON response you wish to return. The maximum response size is 32 KB.
4. (Optional) Configure additional rate limiting features, based on your plan.
5. Select Save and Deploy.

### Using a custom HTML page or a redirect

If you wish to display a custom HTML page, configure an custom page for HTTP 429 errors (Too many requests) in the dashboard. Cloudflare will display this page when you select Default Cloudflare Rate Limiting Page in Response type (the default value for the field).

You can use the following method to redirect a rate-limited client to a specific URL:

1. Create an HTML page on your server that will redirect to the final URL of the page you wish to display. Include a meta refresh ‚Üó tag in the page content, like in the following example:
<!doctype html><html>  <head>    <meta charset="utf-8" />    <title>Custom RL page</title>    <meta      http-equiv="refresh"      content="0; url='https://yourzonename/block'"    />  </head>
  <body></body></html>
Take note of the public URL of the page you created.
2. In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the Settings page.
  Go to Settings
3. Go to Error Pages.
4. Next to Rate limiting block, select the three dots > Edit.
5. Select Custom page.
6. In Custom page address, enter the URL of the page you created on your server ‚Äî the page containing the meta refresh tag.
7. Select Save.

Follow the same approach if you wish to return plain text or JSON content but the response is larger than 32 KB. In this case, the redirect URL would be the URL of the plain text or JSON resource you would like to display.

Notes

- Your rate limiting rule must not match the redirect URL you included in the custom HTML page for 429 errors.
- To protect from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, the page for the redirect should only include resources cached by Cloudflare.

## Task 4: Configure the Bypass option (Enterprise plans only)

Bypass creates an allowlist or exception so that no actions apply to a specific set of URLs even if the rate limit is matched.

To configure Bypass:

1. Expand Bypass.
2. In Bypass rule for these URLs, enter the URL(s) to exempt from the rate limiting rule. Enter each URL on its own line. An HTTP or HTTPS specified in the URL is automatically removed when the rule is saved and instead applies to both HTTP and HTTPS.
3. (Optional) Configure additional rate limiting features, based on your plan.
4. Select Save and Deploy.

## Analytics

View rate limiting analytics in Analytics > Security. Rate Limiting analytics uses solid lines to represent traffic that matches simulated requests and dotted lines to portray actual blocked requests. Logs generated by a rate limiting rule are only visible to Enterprise customers via Cloudflare Logs.

Cloudflare returns an HTTP 429 error for blocked requests. Details on blocked requests per location are provided to Enterprise customers under Status codes in the analytics dashboard available at Analytics > Traffic.

Note

HTTP 429 responses sent to website visitors will include any HTTP 429 responses returned from the origin if the origin server also applies its own rate limiting.

## Order of rule execution

Rate limiting rules are evaluated from the most recently created rule to the oldest rule.

For example, if a request matches the following two rules:

- Rule #1: Matching with test.example.com (created on 2024-03-01)
- Rule #2: Matching with *.example.com* (created on 2024-03-12)

Then rule #2 will trigger first because it was created last.

Additionally, when there is a match and the WAF applies a Log action, it continues evaluating other rate limiting rules, since Log is a non-terminating action. If the WAF applies any other action, no other rules will be evaluated.

## Limitations

Rate Limiting is designed to limit surges in traffic that exceed a user-defined rate. The system is not designed to allow a precise number of requests to reach the origin server. There might be cases where a delay is introduced between detecting the request and updating the internal counter. Because of this delay, which can be up to a few seconds, excess requests could still reach the origin before an action such as blocking or challenging is enforced.

## Troubleshooting

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/troubleshooting/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/troubleshooting/)

Page options # Troubleshooting

A few common rate limiting configuration issues prevent proper request matches:

- Including HTTP or HTTPS protocol schemes in rule patterns (such as https://example.com/*). To restrict rules to match only HTTP or HTTPS traffic, use the schemes array in the request match. For example, "schemes": [ "HTTPS" ].
- Forgetting a trailing slash character (/). Cloudflare Rate Limiting only treats requests for the homepage (such as example.com and example.com/) as equivalent, but not any other path (such as example.com/path/ and example.com/path).¬†To match request paths both with and without the trailing slash, use a wildcard match (for example, example.com/path*).
- Including a query string or anchor (such as example.com/path?foo=bar or example.com/path#section1). A rule like example.com/path will match requests for example.com/path?foo=bar.
- Overriding a rate limit with IP Access rules.
- Including a port number (such as example.com:8443/api/). Rate Limiting does not consider port numbers within rules. Remove the port number from the URL so that the rate limit rule triggers as expected.

## Common API errors

The following common errors may prevent configuring rate limiting rules via the Cloudflare API:

- Decoding is not yet implemented ‚Äì Indicates that your request is missing the Content-Type: application/json header. Add the header to your API request to fix the issue.
- Ratelimit.api.not_entitled ‚Äì Enterprise customers must contact their account team before adding rules.

Note

The origin_traffic parameter can only be set on Enterprise plans. Setting "origin_traffic" = false for a rule on a Free, Pro, or Business domain is automatically converted into "origin_traffic" = true.

## Rate limiting (previous version) upgrade

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/upgrade/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/old-rate-limiting/upgrade/)

Page options # Rate limiting (previous version) upgrade

Cloudflare is upgrading all rate limiting rules created in the previous version to the new version of rate limiting rules.

The Cloudflare dashboard will now show all your rate limiting rules in a single list.

Deprecation notice

The Rate Limiting API and the cloudflare_rate_limit ‚Üó Terraform resource for the previous version of rate limiting rules are now deprecated.

This API and Terraform resource are no longer supported since 2025-06-15. You must use the Rulesets API and the cloudflare_ruleset ‚Üó Terraform resource to configure rate limiting rules.

## Main differences

- Billing model: The previous version of Rate Limiting was billed based on usage and it was available as an add-on on all plans, while the new version is included in Cloudflare plans. For Enterprise plans, Rate Limiting is priced based on total contracted HTTP traffic. The new rate limiting rules offer all the capabilities available on the previous version of rate limiting along with several additional features.
- Advanced scope expressions: The previous version of Rate Limiting allowed you to scope the rules based on a single path and method of the request. In the new version, you can write rules similar to WAF custom rules, combining multiple parameters of the HTTP request.
- Separate counting and mitigation expressions: In the new version of Rate Limiting, counting and mitigation expressions are separate (for Business and Enterprise customers). The counting expression defines which requests are used to compute the rate. The mitigation expression defines which requests are mitigated once the threshold has been reached. Using these separate expressions, you can track the rate of requests on a specific path such as /login and, when an IP exceeds the threshold, block every request from the same IP addressed at your domain.
- Additional counting dimensions (Advanced Rate Limiting only): Like in the previous version of Rate Limiting, customers with the new Rate Limiting get IP-based rate limiting, where Cloudflare counts requests based on the source IP address of incoming requests. In addition to IP-based rate limiting, customers with the new Rate Limiting who subscribe to Advanced Rate Limiting can group requests based on other characteristics, such as the value of API keys, cookies, session headers, ASN, query parameters, or a specific JSON body field. Refer to Rate limiting best practices for examples.
- Number of rules per plan: Besides the exact features per Cloudflare plan, the number of rules per plan is different in the new version of Rate Limiting (for information on the new version limits, refer to Rate limiting rules):


























ProductFreeProBusinessEnterprise with RL add-on, or equivalent planRate Limiting (previous version)11015100Rate Limiting (new version)125100
Enterprise customers must have application security on their contract to get access to rate limiting rules.
Refer to Important remarks about the upgrade for details on how Cloudflare will adjust your rules quota, if needed, after the upgrade.

For more details on the differences between old and new rate limiting rules, refer to our blog post ‚Üó.

## Important remarks about the upgrade

- After the upgrade, you will not be able to create or edit rate limiting rules while you are above the new rules quota for your Cloudflare plan. The number of rate limiting rules included in your Cloudflare plan can be lower than before. If you are over the new limit, you will need to either upgrade to a plan that gives you more rules, or delete existing rules until the number of rules is less or equal to the new maximum number of rules for your plan.
- Custom timeouts will be rounded to the nearest supported timeout. Both custom counting periods and custom mitigation timeouts will be rounded up or down to the nearest counting period and mitigation timeout supported in the new version (refer to Availability for details on the available values per plan).
For example, if you had a rate limiting rule with a mitigation timeout of 55 seconds, this timeout will be rounded up to one minute (nearest value).
Enterprise customers will be able to set a custom mitigation timeout for a rule after the upgrade, but this configuration is only available via API.
- Customers on a Business plan (or higher) will have access to the IP with NAT support characteristic. This characteristic is used to handle situations such as requests under NAT sharing the same IP address.

### Relevant changes in the dashboard

If you had access to the previous version of Cloudflare Rate Limiting, you will now find all rate limiting rules in the same list in Security > WAF > Rate limiting rules.
Rate limiting rules created in the previous version are tagged with Previous version in the Cloudflare dashboard.

If you are using the new application security dashboard, only the rate limiting rules that have been upgraded to the new version will be shown at Security > Security rules.

If you edit a rule with this tag in the dashboard, you will no longer be able to edit the rule using the API and Terraform resource for the previous version of rate limiting rules. In this case, you will need to start using the Rulesets API or the cloudflare_ruleset ‚Üó Terraform resource for this purpose. Refer to Relevant changes for API users and Relevant changes for Terraform users for more information.

### Relevant changes for API users

The previous Rate Limiting API is deprecated. The API is no longer supported since 2025-06-15. You must update any automation based on the previous Rate Limiting API to the Rulesets API to prevent any issues.

The new rate limiting rules are based on the Ruleset Engine. To configure these rate limiting rules via the API you must use the Rulesets API. Since rate limiting rules created in the previous version were upgraded to the new version, this API will also return these rules created in the new version.

The Rulesets API is the only API that allows you to create, edit, and delete any rate limiting rule, regardless of the implementation version where you created the rule. The previous Rate Limiting API will only work with rate limiting rules created in the previous version that you have not edited in the dashboard or modified through the new API/Terraform resource since they were upgraded to the new version.

Until the API sunset date, you can use the previous Rate Limiting API to create, edit, and delete rate limiting rules created in the previous version (which Cloudflare upgraded to the new version). However, if you use the Rulesets API to edit a rule created in the previous version, or if you change such a rule in the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Äì including changing the rule order ‚Äì you will no longer be able to manage this rule (upgraded from the previous version and then updated using the Rulesets API) using the old API operations. In this case, you will need to completely switch to the Rulesets API for managing this specific rule.

### Relevant changes for Terraform users

The cloudflare_rate_limit Terraform resource is deprecated. The resource is no longer supported since 2025-06-15. You must manually update your rate limiting configuration in Terraform from cloudflare_rate_limit ‚Üó resources to cloudflare_ruleset ‚Üó resources to prevent any issues.

The new rate limiting rules are based on the Ruleset Engine. To configure these rate limiting rules with Terraform you must use the cloudflare_ruleset Terraform resource.

The cloudflare_ruleset ‚Üó Terraform resource is the only resource that allows you to create, edit, and delete any rate limiting rule, regardless of the implementation version where you created the rule. The cloudflare_rate_limit Terraform resource will only work with rate limiting rules created in the previous version that you have not edited in the dashboard or modified through the new API/Terraform resource since they were upgraded to the new version.

Until the sunset date for the cloudflare_rate_limit Terraform resource, you can use this resource to create, edit, and delete rate limiting rules created in the previous version (which Cloudflare upgraded to the new version). However, if you start using the cloudflare_ruleset Terraform resource to manage a rule created in the previous version, or if you edit such a rule in the Cloudflare dashboard ‚Äì including changing the rule order ‚Äì you will no longer be able to manage this rule (upgraded from the previous version and then updated using the new resource) using the old Terraform resource. In this case, you will need to completely switch to the cloudflare_ruleset Terraform resource for managing this specific rule.

Refer to the Terraform documentation for examples of configuring the new rate limiting rules using Terraform.

### Replace your configuration with cf-terraforming

You can use the cf-terraforming ‚Üó tool to generate your new Terraform configuration for rate limiting rules created in the previous version. Then, you can import the new resources to Terraform state.

The recommended steps for replacing your old rate limiting configuration in Terraform with a new ruleset configuration are the following.

1. Run the following command to generate all ruleset configurations for a zone:
Terminal windowcf-terraforming generate --zone <ZONE_ID> --resource-type "cloudflare_ruleset"
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31" {  kind    = "zone"  name    = "default"  phase   = "http_ratelimit"  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  rules {    # (...)  }  # (...)}# (...)
2. The previous command may return additional ruleset configurations for other Cloudflare products also based on the Ruleset Engine. Since you are updating your rate limiting rules configuration, keep only the Terraform resource for the http_ratelimit phase and save it to a .tf configuration file. You will need the full resource name in the next step.
3. Import the cloudflare_ruleset resource you previously identified into Terraform state using the terraform import command. For example:
Terminal windowterraform import cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31 zone/<ZONE_ID>/3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31
cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Importing from ID "zone/<ZONE_ID>/3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31"...cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Import prepared!  Prepared cloudflare_ruleset for importcloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Refreshing state... [id=3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31]
Import successful!
The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now inyour Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
4. Run terraform plan to validate that Terraform now checks the state of the new cloudflare_ruleset resource, in addition to other existing resources already managed by Terraform. For example:
Terminal windowterraform plan
cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Refreshing state... [id=3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31][...]cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules: Refreshing state... [id=0580eb5d92e344ddb2374979f74c3ddf][...]
5. Remove any state related to rate limiting rules configured through the old cloudflare_rate_limit resource from your Terraform state:
ImportantYou must remove rate limiting rules configured through the cloudflare_rate_limit resource from Terraform state before deleting their configuration from .tf configuration files to prevent issues.


Run the following command to find all resources related to rate limiting rules (previous version):
Terminal windowterraform state list | grep -E '^cloudflare_rate_limit\.'
cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules


Run the terraform state rm ... command in dry-run mode to understand the impact of removing those resources without performing any changes:
Terminal windowterraform state rm -dry-run cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules
Would remove cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules


If the impact looks correct, run the same command without the -dry-run parameter to actually remove the resources from Terraform state:
Terminal windowterraform state rm cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules
Removed cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rulesSuccessfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
6. Run the following command to find all resources related to rate limiting rules (previous version):
Terminal windowterraform state list | grep -E '^cloudflare_rate_limit\.'
cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules
7. Run the terraform state rm ... command in dry-run mode to understand the impact of removing those resources without performing any changes:
Terminal windowterraform state rm -dry-run cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules
Would remove cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules
8. If the impact looks correct, run the same command without the -dry-run parameter to actually remove the resources from Terraform state:
Terminal windowterraform state rm cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rules
Removed cloudflare_rate_limit.my_rate_limiting_rulesSuccessfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
9. After removing cloudflare_rate_limit resources from Terraform state, delete all these resources from .tf configuration files.
10. Run terraform plan to verify that the resources you deleted from configuration files no longer appear. You should not have any pending changes.
Terminal windowterraform plan
cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Refreshing state... [id=3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31][...]
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

## Firewall rules upgrade

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/firewall-rules-upgrade/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/legacy/firewall-rules-upgrade/)

Page options # Firewall rules upgrade

Cloudflare upgraded existing firewall rules into custom rules. With custom rules, you get the same level of protection and a few additional features. Custom rules are available in the Cloudflare dashboard in the following location:

- Old dashboard: Security > WAF > Custom rules.
- New security dashboard: Security > Security rules.

Deprecation notice

Cloudflare Firewall Rules is now deprecated. The Firewall Rules API and Filters API, as well as the cloudflare_firewall_rule and cloudflare_filter Terraform resources, are no longer supported since 2025-06-15. If you have any automation based on these APIs and resources, you must migrate to the new APIs and resources to avoid any issues.

If you have not upgraded to WAF custom rules yet, you may have some invalid configuration that prevents the upgrade from happening. In this case, contact your account team to get help with the upgrade to WAF custom rules.

## Main differences

The main differences between firewall rules and WAF custom rules are the following:

- Improved response for Block action
- Different error page for blocked requests
- New Skip action replacing both Allow and Bypass actions
- Custom rules are evaluated in order
- Logs and events
- New API and Terraform resources

### Improved response for Block action

In WAF custom rules you can customize the response of the Block action.

The default block response is a Cloudflare standard HTML page. If you need to send a custom response for Block actions, configure the custom rule to return a fixed response with a custom response code (403, by default) and a custom body (HTML, JSON, XML, or plain text).

To define a custom response for a single rule, go to Security > WAF > Custom rules ‚Üó, edit the custom rule, and fill in the block-related options.

Note

Custom block response configurations are not returned by the Firewall Rules API. You must use the Rulesets API to manage this new feature.

### Different error page for blocked requests

Requests blocked by a firewall rule with a Block action would get a Cloudflare 1020 error code response. Cloudflare users could customize this error page for a zone in Error Pages > 1000 class errors.

Requests blocked by a WAF custom rule will get a different response: the WAF block response. To customize the default block response, you can either:

- Define a custom WAF block response for your entire zone in Error Pages ‚Üó > WAF block. This error page will always have an HTML content type.
- Define a custom response for requests blocked by a specific WAF custom rule. This custom response supports other content types besides HTML.

If you have customized your 1XXX error page in Error Pages for requests blocked by firewall rules, you will need to create a new response page for blocked requests using one of the above methods.

For more information on Error Pages, refer to Custom Errors.

### New Skip action replacing both Allow and Bypass actions

Firewall Rules supported the Allow and Bypass actions, often used together. These actions were commonly used for handling known legitimate requests ‚Äî for example, requests coming from trusted IP addresses.

When a request triggered Allow, all remaining firewall rules were not evaluated, effectively allowing the request to continue to the next security product. The Bypass action was designed to specify which security products (such as WAF managed rules, rate limiting rules, and User Agent Blocking) should not run on the request triggering the action.

With Firewall Rules, if you wanted to stop running all security products for a given request, you would create two rules:

- One rule with Bypass action (selecting all security products).
- One rule with Allow action (to stop executing other firewall rules).

The requirement of having two rules to address this common scenario no longer applies to WAF custom rules. You should now use the Skip action, which combines the Allow and Bypass actions. The Skip action fully replaces the Allow and Bypass actions, which are not supported in WAF custom rules.

With the Skip action you can do the following:

- Stop running all the remaining custom rules (equivalent to the Allow action)
- Avoid running other security products (equivalent to the Bypass action)
- A combination of the above.

You can also select whether you want to log events matching the custom rule with the Skip action or not. This is especially useful when creating a positive security model to avoid logging large amounts of legitimate traffic.

Note

The Firewall Rules API does not support the Skip action. When you create a custom rule with Skip action, it is translated to Allow and Bypass in the Firewall Rules API. You must use the Rulesets API to fully use the new Skip action functionality.

### Custom rules are evaluated in order

Firewall rules actions had a specific order of precedence when using priority ordering. In contrast, custom rules actions do not have such an order. Custom rules are always evaluated in order, and some actions like Block will stop the evaluation of other rules.

For example, if you were using priority ordering and had the following firewall rules with the same priority both matching an incoming request:

- Firewall rule #1 ‚Äî Priority: 2 / Action: Block
- Firewall rule #2 ‚Äî Priority: 2 / Action: Allow

The request would be allowed, since the Allow action in Firewall Rules would have precedence over the Block action.

In contrast, if you create two custom rules where both rules match an incoming request:

- Custom rule #1 ‚Äî Action: Block
- Custom rule #2 ‚Äî Action: Skip (configured to skip all remaining custom rules)

The request would be blocked, since custom rules are evaluated in order and the Block action will stop the evaluation of other rules.

Note

For the custom rules converted from your existing firewall rules, Cloudflare will preserve your current order of execution.

### Logs and events

Events logged by custom rules are shown in Security Events with Custom Rules as their source.

You may still find events generated by Firewall Rules in the Security Events page when you select a time frame including the days when the transition to custom rules occurred. Similarly, you may still find events with both Skip and Allow actions in the same view during the transition period.

### New API and Terraform resources

The preferred API for managing WAF custom rules is the Rulesets API. The Rulesets API is used on all recent Cloudflare security products to provide a uniform user experience when interacting with our API. For more information on migrating to the Rulesets API, refer to Relevant changes for API users.

The Firewall Rules API and Filters API are no longer supported since 2025-06-15. There is now a single list of rules for both firewall rules and WAF custom rules, and this list contains WAF custom rules. Thanks to an internal conversion process, the Firewall Rules API and Filters API return firewall rules/filters converted from these WAF custom rules until the APIs sunset date.

If you are using Terraform, you must update your configuration to use cloudflare_ruleset ‚Üó resources with the http_request_firewall_custom phase to manage custom rules. For more information on updating your Terraform configuration, refer to Relevant changes for Terraform users.

## Relevant changes for dashboard users

The Firewall Rules tab in the Cloudflare dashboard is now deprecated. Firewall rules are displayed as custom rules in the Cloudflare dashboard.

For users that have access to both products, the Firewall rules tab is only available in the old dashboard in Security > WAF.

## Relevant changes for API users

The Firewall Rules API and the associated Cloudflare Filters API are now deprecated. These APIs are no longer supported since 2025-06-15. You must manually update any automation based on the Firewall Rules API or Cloudflare Filters API to the Rulesets API to prevent any issues. Rule IDs are different between firewall rules and custom rules, which may affect automated processes dealing with specific rule IDs.

Before the APIs sunset date, Cloudflare will internally convert your Firewall Rules API and Filters API calls into the corresponding Rulesets API calls. The converted API calls between the Firewall Rules API/Filters API and the Rulesets API appear in audit logs as generated by Cloudflare and not by the actual user making the requests. There will be a single list of rules for both firewall rules and WAF custom rules.

Some new features of WAF custom rules, like custom responses for blocked requests and the Skip action, are not supported in the Firewall Rules API. To take advantage of these features, Cloudflare recommends that you use the custom rules page in the Cloudflare dashboard or the Rulesets API.

Refer to the WAF documentation for examples of managing WAF custom rules using the Rulesets API.

## Relevant changes for Terraform users

The following Terraform resources from the Cloudflare provider are now deprecated:

- cloudflare_firewall_rule ‚Üó
- cloudflare_filter ‚Üó

These resources are no longer supported since 2025-06-15. If you are using these resources to manage your Firewall Rules configuration, you must manually update any Terraform configuration to cloudflare_ruleset ‚Üó resources to prevent any issues.

There will be a single list of rules for both firewall rules and WAF custom rules.

Some new features of WAF custom rules are not supported in the deprecated Terraform resources. To take advantage of these features, Cloudflare recommends that you use the cloudflare_ruleset resource.

Refer to the documentation about Terraform for examples of configuring WAF custom rules using Terraform.

### Replace your configuration using cf-terraforming

You can use the cf-terraforming ‚Üó tool to generate the Terraform configuration for your current WAF custom rules (converted by Cloudflare from your firewall rules). Then, import the new resources to Terraform state.

The recommended steps for replacing your firewall rules (and filters) configuration in Terraform with a new ruleset configuration are the following.

1. Run the following command to generate all ruleset configurations for a zone:
Terminal windowcf-terraforming generate --zone <ZONE_ID> --resource-type "cloudflare_ruleset"
resource "cloudflare_ruleset" "terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31" {  kind    = "zone"  name    = "default"  phase   = "http_request_firewall_custom"  zone_id = "<ZONE_ID>"  rules {    [...]  }  [...]}[...]
2. The previous command may return additional ruleset configurations for other Cloudflare products also based on the Ruleset Engine. Since you are migrating firewall rules to custom rules, keep only the Terraform resource for the http_request_firewall_custom phase and save it to a .tf configuration file. You will need the full resource name in the next step.
3. Import the cloudflare_ruleset resource you previously identified into Terraform state using the terraform import command. For example:
Terminal windowterraform import cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31 zone/<ZONE_ID>/3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31
cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Importing from ID "zone/<ZONE_ID>/3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31"...cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Import prepared!  Prepared cloudflare_ruleset for importcloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Refreshing state... [id=3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31]
Import successful!
The resources that were imported are shown above. These resources are now inyour Terraform state and will henceforth be managed by Terraform.
4. Run terraform plan to validate that Terraform now checks the state of the new cloudflare_ruleset resource, in addition to other existing resources already managed by Terraform. For example:
Terminal windowterraform plan
cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Refreshing state... [id=3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31][...]cloudflare_filter.my_filter: Refreshing state... [id=14a2524fd75c419f8d273116815b6349]cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule: Refreshing state... [id=0580eb5d92e344ddb2374979f74c3ddf][...]
5. Remove any state related to firewall rules and filters from your Terraform state:
WarningYou must remove firewall rules and filters from Terraform state before deleting their configuration from .tf configuration files to prevent issues.


Run the following command to find all resources related to firewall rules and filters:
Terminal windowterraform state list | grep -E '^cloudflare_(filter|firewall_rule)\.'
cloudflare_filter.my_filtercloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule


Run the terraform state rm ... command in dry-run mode to understand the impact of removing those resources without performing any changes:
Terminal windowterraform state rm -dry-run cloudflare_filter.my_filter cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule
Would remove cloudflare_filter.my_filterWould remove cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule


If the impact looks correct, run the same command without the -dry-run parameter to actually remove the resources from Terraform state:
Terminal windowterraform state rm cloudflare_filter.my_filter cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule
Removed cloudflare_filter.my_filterRemoved cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_ruleSuccessfully removed 2 resource instance(s).
6. Run the following command to find all resources related to firewall rules and filters:
Terminal windowterraform state list | grep -E '^cloudflare_(filter|firewall_rule)\.'
cloudflare_filter.my_filtercloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule
7. Run the terraform state rm ... command in dry-run mode to understand the impact of removing those resources without performing any changes:
Terminal windowterraform state rm -dry-run cloudflare_filter.my_filter cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule
Would remove cloudflare_filter.my_filterWould remove cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule
8. If the impact looks correct, run the same command without the -dry-run parameter to actually remove the resources from Terraform state:
Terminal windowterraform state rm cloudflare_filter.my_filter cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_rule
Removed cloudflare_filter.my_filterRemoved cloudflare_firewall_rule.my_firewall_ruleSuccessfully removed 2 resource instance(s).
9. After removing firewall rules and filters resources from Terraform state, delete cloudflare_filter and cloudflare_firewall_rule resources from .tf configuration files.
10. Run terraform plan to verify that the resources you deleted from configuration files no longer appear. You should not have any pending changes.
Terminal windowterraform plan
cloudflare_ruleset.terraform_managed_resource_3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31: Refreshing state... [id=3c0b456bc2aa443089c5f40f45f51b31][...]
No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.
Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

For details on importing Cloudflare resources to Terraform and using the cf-terraforming tool, refer to the following resources:

- Import Cloudflare resources
- cf-terraforming GitHub repository ‚Üó

## Final remarks

Any unpaused firewall rules with paused filters will become enabled when converted to custom rules.

## Changelog

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/change-log/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/change-log/)

Page options # Changelog

The WAF changelog provides information about changes to managed rulesets and general updates to WAF protection.

## Changelog for managed rulesets

Cloudflare has a regular cadence of releasing updates and new rules to WAF managed rulesets. The updates either improve a rule's accuracy, lower false positives rates, or increase the protection due to a change in the threat landscape.

The release cycle for new rules happens on a 7-day cycle, typically every Monday or Tuesday depending on public holidays. For existing rule updates, Cloudflare will initially deploy the updated rule as a BETA rule (denoted in rule description) and with a BETA tag, before updating the original rule on the next release cycle. Cloudflare will deploy the updated or new rules into logging only mode (Log action), with BETA and New tags. Essentially, any newly created rules will carry both the BETA and New tags. Logging only mode allows you to identify any increases in security event volumes which look like potential false positives. On the following Monday (or Tuesday) the rules will change from logging only mode to the intended default action (New Action column in the changelog table), with the BETA and New tags removed.

Cloudflare is very proactive in responding to new vulnerabilities, which may need to be released outside of the 7-day cycle, defined as an Emergency Release.

Warning

Ruleset overrides and tag overrides apply to existing and future rules in the managed ruleset, which includes changes in regular and emergency releases.

If you do notice a new or updated rule generating an increased volume of security events, you can disable or change the rule from its Default action. Once you change a rule to use an action other than the default one, Cloudflare will not be able to override the rule action.

WAF Release - 2025-08-18 This week's update

This week, a series of critical vulnerabilities were discovered impacting core enterprise and open-source infrastructure. These flaws present a range of risks, providing attackers with distinct pathways for remote code execution, methods to breach internal network boundaries, and opportunities for critical data exposure and operational disruption.

Key Findings

- SonicWall SMA (CVE-2025-32819, CVE-2025-32820, CVE-2025-32821): A remote authenticated attacker with SSLVPN user privileges can bypass path traversal protections. These vulnerabilities enable a attacker to bypass security checks to read, modify, or delete arbitrary files. An attacker with administrative privileges can escalate this further, using a command injection flaw to upload malicious files, which could ultimately force the appliance to reboot to its factory default settings.
- Ms-Swift Project (CVE-2025-50460): An unsafe deserialization vulnerability exists in the Ms-Swift project's handling of YAML configuration files. If an attacker can control the content of a configuration file passed to the application, they can embed a malicious payload that will execute arbitrary code and it can be executed during deserialization.
- Apache Druid (CVE-2023-25194): This vulnerability in Apache Druid allows an attacker to cause the server to connect to a malicious LDAP server. By sending a specially crafted LDAP response, the attacker can trigger an unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data. If specific "gadgets" (classes that can be abused) are present in the server's classpath, this can be escalated to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- Tenda AC8v4 (CVE-2025-51087, CVE-2025-51088): Vulnerabilities allow an authenticated attacker to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow. By sending malformed arguments in a request to specific endpoints, an attacker can crash the device or potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.
- Open WebUI (CVE-2024-7959): This vulnerability allows a user to change the OpenAI URL endpoint to an arbitrary internal network address without proper validation. This flaw can be exploited to access internal services or cloud metadata endpoints, potentially leading to remote command execution if the attacker can retrieve instance secrets or access sensitive internal APIs.
- BentoML (CVE-2025-54381): The vulnerability exists in the serialization/deserialization handlers for multipart form data and JSON requests, which automatically download files from user-provided URLs without proper validation of internal network addresses. This allows attackers to fetch from unintended internal services, including cloud metadata and localhost.
- Adobe Experience Manager Forms (CVE-2025-54254): An Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE') vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary file system read in Adobe AEM (‚â§6.5.23).

Impact

These vulnerabilities affect core infrastructure, from network security appliances like SonicWall to data platforms such as Apache Druid and ML frameworks like BentoML. The code execution and deserialization flaws are particularly severe, offering deep system access that allows attackers to steal data, disrupt services, and establish a foothold for broader intrusions. Simultaneously, SSRF and XXE vulnerabilities undermine network boundaries, exposing sensitive internal data and creating pathways for lateral movement. Beyond data-centric threats, flaws in edge devices like the Tenda router introduce the tangible risk of operational disruption, highlighting a multi-faceted threat to the security and stability of key enterprise systems.

- Kentico Xperience CMS (CVE-2025-2747, CVE-2025-2748): Vulnerabilities in Kentico Xperience CMS could enable cross-site scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages. Additionally, a flaw could allow unauthenticated attackers to bypass the Staging Sync Server's authentication, potentially leading to administrative control over the CMS.
- Node.js (CVE-2025-27210): An incomplete fix for a previous vulnerability (CVE-2025-23084) in Node.js affects the path.join() API method on Windows systems. The vulnerability can be triggered using reserved Windows device names such as CON, PRN, or AUX.
- WordPress:Plugin:Simple File List (CVE-2025-34085, CVE-2020-36847):
This vulnerability in the Simple File List plugin for WordPress allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to upload arbitrary files to a vulnerable site. This can be exploited to achieve remote code execution on the server.
(Note: CVE-2025-34085 has been rejected as a duplicate.)
- GeoServer (CVE-2024-29198): A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in GeoServer's Demo request endpoint, which can be exploited where the Proxy Base URL has not been configured.
- Ivanti EPMM (CVE-2025-6771): An OS command injection vulnerability in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) before versions 12.5.0.2, 12.4.0.3, and 12.3.0.3 allows a remote, authenticated attacker with high privileges to execute arbitrary code.
- Microsoft SharePoint (CVE-2024-38018): This is a remote code execution vulnerability affecting Microsoft SharePoint Server.
- Manager-IO (CVE-2025-54122): A critical unauthenticated full read Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability is present in the proxy handler of both Manager Desktop and Server editions up to version 25.7.18.2519. This allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass network isolation and access internal services.
- Ingress-Nginx (CVE-2025-1974): A vulnerability in the Ingress-Nginx controller for Kubernetes allows an attacker to bypass access control rules. An unauthenticated attacker with access to the pod network can achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the ingress-nginx controller.
- PaperCut NG/MF (CVE-2023-2533): A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in PaperCut NG/MF. Under specific conditions, an attacker could exploit this to alter security settings or execute arbitrary code if they can deceive an administrator with an active login session into clicking a malicious link.
- SonicWall SMA (CVE-2025-40598): This vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to bypass security controls. This allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
- WordPress (CVE-2025-5394): The "Alone ‚Äì Charity Multipurpose Non-profit WordPress Theme" for WordPress  is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads. A missing capability check allows unauthenticated attackers to upload ZIP files containing webshells disguised as plugins, leading to remote code execution.

Impact

These vulnerabilities span a broad range of enterprise technologies, including network access control systems, monitoring platforms, web servers, CMS platforms, cloud services, and collaboration tools. Exploitation techniques range from remote code execution and command injection to authentication bypass, SQL injection, path traversal, and configuration weaknesses.

A critical flaw in perimeter devices like Ivanti EPMM or SonicWall SMA could allow an unauthenticated attacker to gain remote code execution, completely breaching the primary network defense. A separate vulnerability within Cisco's Identity Services Engine could then be exploited to bypass network segmentation, granting an attacker widespread internal access. Insecure deserialization issues in platforms like Wazuh Server and CrushFTP could then be used to run malicious payloads or steal sensitive files from administrative consoles. Weaknesses in web delivery controllers like Ingress-Nginx or popular content management systems such as WordPress, SharePoint, and Kentico Xperience create vectors to bypass security controls, exfiltrate confidential data, or fully compromise servers.

## 2025-08-07

WAF Release - 2025-08-07 - Emergency This week‚Äôs highlight focuses on two critical vulnerabilities affecting key infrastructure and enterprise content management platforms. Both flaws present significant remote code execution risks that can be exploited with minimal or no user interaction.

Key Findings

- Squid (‚â§6.3) ‚Äî CVE-2025-54574: A heap buffer overflow occurs when processing Uniform Resource Names (URNs). This vulnerability may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server. The issue has been resolved in version 6.4.
- Adobe AEM (‚â§6.5.23) ‚Äî CVE-2025-54253: Due to a misconfiguration, attackers can achieve remote code execution without requiring any user interaction, posing a severe threat to affected deployments.

Impact

Both vulnerabilities expose critical attack vectors that can lead to full server compromise. The Squid heap buffer overflow allows remote code execution by crafting malicious URNs, which can lead to server takeover or denial of service. Given Squid‚Äôs widespread use as a caching proxy, this flaw could be exploited to disrupt network traffic or gain footholds inside secure environments.

Adobe AEM‚Äôs remote code execution vulnerability enables attackers to run arbitrary code on the content management server without any user involvement. This puts sensitive content, application integrity, and the underlying infrastructure at extreme risk. Exploitation could lead to data theft, defacement, or persistent backdoor installation.

These findings reinforce the urgency of updating to the patched versions ‚Äî Squid 6.4 and Adobe AEM 6.5.24 or later ‚Äî and reviewing configurations to prevent exploitation.

## 2025-08-04

WAF Release - 2025-08-04 This week's highlight focuses on a series of significant vulnerabilities identified across widely adopted web platforms, from enterprise-grade CMS to essential backend administration tools. The findings reveal multiple vectors for attack, including critical flaws that allow for full server compromise and others that enable targeted attacks against users.

Key Findings

- Sitecore (CVE-2025-34509, CVE-2025-34510, CVE-2025-34511): A hardcoded credential allows remote attackers to access administrative APIs. Once authenticated, they can exploit an additional vulnerability to upload arbitrary files, leading to remote code execution.
- Grafana (CVE-2025-4123): A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows an attacker to redirect users to a malicious website, which can then execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
- LaRecipe (CVE-2025-53833): Through Server-Side Template Injection, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially access sensitive environment variables, and escalate access depending on server configuration.
- CentOS WebPanel (CVE-2025-48703): A command injection vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
- WordPress (CVE-2023-5561): This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to determine the email addresses of users who have published public posts on an affected website.
- WordPress Plugin - WPBookit (CVE-2025-6058): A missing file type validation allows unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files to the server, creating the potential for remote code execution.
- WordPress Theme - Motors (CVE-2025-4322): Due to improper identity validation, an unauthenticated attacker can change the passwords of arbitrary users, including administrators, to gain access to their accounts.

Impact

These vulnerabilities pose a multi-layered threat to widely adopted web technologies, ranging from enterprise-grade platforms like Sitecore to everyday solutions such as WordPress, and backend tools like CentOS WebPanel. The most severe risks originate in remote code execution (RCE) flaws found in Sitecore, CentOS WebPanel, LaRecipe, and the WPBookit plugin. These allow attackers to bypass security controls and gain deep access to the server, enabling them to steal sensitive data, deface websites, install persistent malware, or use the compromised server as a launchpad for further attacks.

The privilege escalation vulnerability is the Motors theme, which allows for a complete administrative account takeover on WordPress sites. This effectively hands control of the application to an attacker, who can then manipulate content, exfiltrate user data, and alter site functionality without needing to breach the server itself.

The Grafana cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw can be used to hijack authenticated user sessions or steal credentials, turning a trusted user's browser into an attack vector.

Meanwhile, the information disclosure flaw in WordPress core provides attackers with valid user emails, fueling targeted phishing campaigns that aim to secure the same account access achievable through the other exploits.

## 2025-07-14

WAF Release - 2025-07-14 This week‚Äôs vulnerability analysis highlights emerging web application threats that exploit modern JavaScript behavior and SQL parsing ambiguities. Attackers continue to refine techniques such as attribute overloading and obfuscated logic manipulation to evade detection and compromise front-end and back-end systems.

Key Findings

- XSS ‚Äì Attribute Overloading: A novel cross-site scripting technique where attackers abuse custom or non-standard HTML attributes to smuggle payloads into the DOM. These payloads evade traditional sanitization logic, especially in frameworks that loosely validate attributes or trust unknown tokens.
- XSS ‚Äì onToggle Event Abuse: Exploits the lesser-used onToggle event (triggered by elements like <details>) to execute arbitrary JavaScript when users interact with UI elements. This vector is often overlooked by static analyzers and can be embedded in seemingly benign components.
- SQLi ‚Äì Obfuscated Boolean Logic: An advanced SQL injection variant that uses non-standard Boolean expressions, comment-based obfuscation, or alternate encodings (for example, /*!true*/, AND/**/1=1) to bypass basic input validation and WAF signatures. This technique is particularly dangerous in dynamic query construction contexts.

## 2025-04-22

WAF Release - 2025-04-22 Each of this week's rule releases covers a distinct CVE, with half of the rules targeting Remote Code Execution (RCE) attacks. Of the 6 CVEs covered, four were scored as critical, with the other two scored as high.

When deciding which exploits to tackle, Cloudflare tunes into the attackers' areas of focus. Cloudflare's network intelligence provides a unique lens into attacker activity ‚Äì for instance, through the volume of blocked requests related with CVE exploits after updating WAF Managed Rules with new detections.

From this week's releases, one indicator that RCE is a "hot topic" attack type is the fact that the Oracle PeopleSoft RCE rule accounts for half of all of the new rule matches. This rule patches CVE-2023-22047, a high-severity vulnerability in the Oracle PeopleSoft suite that allows unauthenticated attackers to access PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools data through remote code execution. This is particularly concerning because of the nature of the data managed by PeopleSoft ‚Äì this can include payroll records or student profile information. This CVE, along with five others, are addressed with the latest detection update to WAF Managed Rules.

## 2025-03-22

New Managed WAF rule for Next.js CVE-2025-29927. Update: Mon Mar 24th, 11PM UTC: Next.js has made further changes to address a smaller vulnerability introduced in the patches made to its middleware handling. Users should upgrade to Next.js versions 15.2.4, 14.2.26, 13.5.10 or 12.3.6. If you are unable to immediately upgrade or are running an older version of Next.js, you can enable the WAF rule described in this changelog as a mitigation.

Update: Mon Mar 24th, 8PM UTC: Next.js has now backported the patch for this vulnerability ‚Üó to cover Next.js v12 and v13. Users on those versions will need to patch to 13.5.9 and 12.3.5 (respectively) to mitigate the vulnerability.

Update: Sat Mar 22nd, 4PM UTC: We have changed this WAF rule to opt-in only, as sites that use auth middleware with third-party auth vendors were observing failing requests.

We strongly recommend updating your version of Next.js (if eligible) to the patched versions, as your app will otherwise be vulnerable to an authentication bypass attack regardless of auth provider.

#### Enable the Managed Rule (strongly recommended)

This rule is opt-in only for sites on the Pro plan or above in the WAF managed ruleset.

To enable the rule:

1. Head to Security > WAF > Managed rules in the Cloudflare dashboard for the zone (website) you want to protect.
2. Click the three dots next to Cloudflare Managed Ruleset and choose Edit
3. Scroll down and choose Browse Rules
4. Search for CVE-2025-29927 (ruleId: 34583778093748cc83ff7b38f472013e)
5. Change the Status to Enabled and the Action to Block. You can optionally set the rule to Log, to validate potential impact before enabling it. Log will not block requests.
6. Click Next
7. Scroll down and choose Save

This will enable the WAF rule and block requests with the x-middleware-subrequest header regardless of Next.js version.

#### Create a WAF rule (manual)

For users on the Free plan, or who want to define a more specific rule, you can create a Custom WAF rule to block requests with the x-middleware-subrequest header regardless of Next.js version.

To create a custom rule:

1. Head to Security > WAF > Custom rules in the Cloudflare dashboard for the zone (website) you want to protect.
2. Give the rule a name - e.g. next-js-CVE-2025-29927
3. Set the matching parameters for the rule match any request where the x-middleware-subrequest header exists per the rule expression below.

Terminal window ```
(len(http.request.headers["x-middleware-subrequest"]) > 0)
```

1. Set the action to 'block'. If you want to observe the impact before blocking requests, set the action to 'log' (and edit the rule later).
2. Deploy the rule.

#### Next.js CVE-2025-29927

We've made a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule available to all sites on Cloudflare to protect against the Next.js authentication bypass vulnerability ‚Üó (CVE-2025-29927) published on March 21st, 2025.

Note: This rule is not enabled by default as it blocked requests across sites for specific authentication middleware.

- This managed rule protects sites using Next.js on Workers and Pages, as well as sites using Cloudflare to protect Next.js applications hosted elsewhere.
- This rule has been made available (but not enabled by default) to all sites as part of our WAF Managed Ruleset and blocks requests that attempt to bypass authentication in Next.js applications.
- The vulnerability affects almost all Next.js versions, and has been fully patched in Next.js 14.2.26 and 15.2.4. Earlier, interim releases did not fully patch this vulnerability.
- Users on older versions of Next.js (11.1.4 to 13.5.6) did not originally have a patch available, but this the patch for this vulnerability and a subsequent additional patch have been backported to Next.js versions 12.3.6 and 13.5.10 as of Monday, March 24th. Users on Next.js v11 will need to deploy the stated workaround or enable the WAF rule.

The managed WAF rule mitigates this by blocking external user requests with the x-middleware-subrequest header regardless of Next.js version, but we recommend users using Next.js 14 and 15 upgrade to the patched versions of Next.js as an additional mitigation.

Improved VPN Managed List Customers can now effectively manage incoming traffic identified as originating from VPN IPs. Customers with compliance restrictions can now ensure compliance with local laws and regulations. Customers with CDN restrictions can use the improved VPN Managed List to prevent unauthorized access from users attempting to bypass geographical restrictions. With the new VPN Managed List enhancements, customers can improve their overall security posture to reduce exposure to unwanted or malicious traffic.

## 2024-12-10

Change the order of list items in IP Lists (for API and Terraform users) Due to changes in the API implementation, the order of list items in an IP list obtained via API or Terraform may change, which may cause Terraform to detect a change in Terraform state. To fix this issue, resync the Terraform state or upgrade the version of your Terraform Cloudflare provider to version 4.44.0 ‚Üó or later.

## 2024-11-14

Security Events pagination Fixed an issue with pagination in Security Events' sampled logs where some pages were missing data. Also removed the total count from the events log as these are only sampled logs.

## 2024-11-04

New table in Security Analytics and Security Events Switched to a new, more responsive table in Security Analytics and Security Events.

## 2024-08-29

Fixed occasional attack score mismatches Fixed an issue causing score mismatches between the global WAF attack score and subscores. In certain cases, subscores were higher (not an attack) than expected while the global attack score was lower than expected (attack), leading to false positives.

## 2024-05-23

Improved detection capabilities WAF attack score now automatically detects and decodes Base64 and JavaScript (Unicode escape sequences) in HTTP requests. This update is available for all customers with access to WAF attack score (Business customers with access to a single field and Enterprise customers).
