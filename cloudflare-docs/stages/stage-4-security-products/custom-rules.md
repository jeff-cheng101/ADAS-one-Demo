## Custom rules

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/)

Page options # Custom rules

Custom rules allow you to control incoming traffic by filtering requests to a zone. They work as customized web application firewall (WAF) rules that you can use to perform actions like Block or Managed Challenge on incoming requests.

In the new security dashboard, custom rules are one of the available types of security rules. Security rules perform security-related actions on incoming requests that match specified filters.

Like other rules evaluated by Cloudflare's Ruleset Engine, custom rules have the following basic parameters:

- An expression that specifies the criteria you are matching traffic on using the Rules language.
- An action that specifies what to perform when there is a match for the rule.

Custom rules are evaluated in order, and some actions like Block will stop the evaluation of other rules. For more details on actions and their behavior, refer to the actions reference.

To define sets of custom rules that apply to more than one zone, use custom rulesets, which require an Enterprise plan with a paid add-on.

## Availability

|  | Free | Pro | Business | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Availability | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Number of rules | 5 | 20 | 100 | 1,000 |
| Supported actions | All except Log | All except Log | All except Log | All |
| Regex support | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Custom rulesets | No | No | No | Paid add-on |

## Next steps

To create custom rules using the Cloudflare dashboard, refer to Create custom rules in the dashboard.

You can also create custom rules via API or using Terraform.

## Create a custom rule via API

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-api/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/create-api/)

Page options # Create a custom rule via API

Use the Rulesets API to create a custom rule via API.

You must deploy custom rules to the http_request_firewall_custom phase entry point ruleset.

If you are using Terraform, refer to WAF custom rules configuration using Terraform.

## Create a custom rule

To create a custom rule for a zone, add a rule  to the http_request_firewall_custom phase entry point ruleset.

1. Invoke the Get a zone entry point ruleset operation to obtain the definition of the entry point ruleset for the http_request_firewall_custom phase. You will need the zone ID for this task.
2. If the entry point ruleset already exists (that is, if you received a 200 OK status code and the ruleset definition), take note of the ruleset ID in the response. Then, invoke the Create a zone ruleset rule operation to add a custom rule to the existing ruleset. Refer to the examples below for details.
3. If the entry point ruleset does not exist (that is, if you received a 404 Not Found status code in step 1), create it using the Create a zone ruleset operation. Include your custom rule in the rules array. Refer to Create ruleset for an example.

### Example A

This example request adds a rule to the http_request_firewall_custom phase entry point ruleset for the zone with ID $ZONE_ID. The entry point ruleset already exists, with ID $RULESET_ID.

The new rule, which will be the last rule in the ruleset, will challenge requests from the United Kingdom or France with an attack score lower than 20.

Create a zone ruleset rule ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "description": "My custom rule",    "expression": "(ip.src.country eq \"GB\" or ip.src.country eq \"FR\") and cf.waf.score lt 20",    "action": "challenge"  }'
```

To define a specific position for the new rule, include a position object in the request body according to the guidelines in Change the order of a rule in a ruleset.

For instructions on creating an entry point ruleset and defining its rules using a single API call, refer to Add rules to phase entry point rulesets.

### Example B

This example request adds a rule to the http_request_firewall_custom phase entry point ruleset for the zone with ID $ZONE_ID. The entry point ruleset already exists, with ID $RULESET_ID.

The new rule, which will be the last rule in the ruleset, includes the definition of a custom response for blocked requests.

Create a zone ruleset rule ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "description": "My custom rule with plain text response",    "expression": "(ip.src.country eq \"GB\" or ip.src.country eq \"FR\") and cf.waf.score lt 20",    "action": "block",    "action_parameters": {        "response": {            "status_code": 403,            "content": "Your request was blocked.",            "content_type": "text/plain"        }    }  }'
```

To define a specific position for the new rule, include a position object in the request body according to the guidelines in Change the order of a rule in a ruleset.

For instructions on creating an entry point ruleset and defining its rules using a single API call, refer to Add rules to phase entry point rulesets.

## Next steps

Use the different operations in the Rulesets API to work with the rule you just created. The following table has a list of common tasks:

| Task | Procedure |
| --- | --- |
| List all rules in ruleset | Use the Get a zone entry point ruleset operation with the http_request_firewall_custom phase name to obtain the list of configured custom rules and their IDs.For more information, refer to View a specific ruleset. |
| Update a rule | Use the Update a zone ruleset rule operation.You will need to provide the ruleset ID and the rule ID. To obtain these IDs, you can use the Get a zone entry point ruleset operation with the http_request_firewall_custom phase name.For more information, refer to Update a rule in a ruleset. |
| Delete a rule | Use the Delete a zone ruleset rule operation.You will need to provide the ruleset ID and the rule ID. To obtain these IDs, you can use the Get a zone entry point ruleset operation with the http_request_firewall_custom phase name.For more information, refer to Delete a rule in a ruleset. |

These operations are covered in the Ruleset Engine documentation. The Ruleset Engine powers different Cloudflare products, including custom rules.

## API examples

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/skip/api-examples/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/skip/api-examples/)

Page options # API examples

Use the Rulesets API to configure custom rules via API.

The skip action supports different skip options, according to the security features or products that you wish to skip.

## Before you continue

This page contains examples of different skip rule scenarios for custom rules. Take the following into account:

- The $ZONE_ID value is the ID of the zone where you want to add the rule.
- The $RULESET_ID value is the ID of the entry point ruleset of the http_request_firewall_custom phase. For details on obtaining this ruleset ID, refer to List and view rulesets. The API examples in this page add a skip rule to an existing ruleset using the Create a zone ruleset rule operation.
However, the entry point ruleset may not exist yet. In this case, invoke the Create a zone ruleset operation to create the entry point ruleset with a skip rule. Refer to Create ruleset for an example.
- Although each example only includes one action parameter, you can use several skip options in the same rule by specifying the ruleset, phases, and products action parameters simultaneously.

## Skip the remaining rules in the current ruleset

This example invokes the Create a zone ruleset rule operation to add a skip rule to the existing http_request_firewall_custom phase entry point ruleset with ID $RULESET_ID. The rule will skip all remaining rules in the current ruleset for requests matching the rule expression.

Create a zone ruleset rule ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "action": "skip",    "action_parameters": {        "ruleset": "current"    },    "expression": "http.request.uri.path contains \"/skip-current-ruleset/\"",    "description": ""  }'
```

## Skip a phase

This example invokes the Create a zone ruleset rule operation to add a rule to the existing http_request_firewall_custom phase entry point ruleset with ID $RULESET_ID. The rule will skip the http_ratelimit phase for requests matching the rule expression.

Create a zone ruleset rule ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "action": "skip",    "action_parameters": {        "phases": [            "http_ratelimit"        ]    },    "expression": "http.request.uri.path contains \"/skip-phase/\"",    "description": ""  }'
```

Refer to Available skip options for the list of phases you can skip.

## Skip a phase and do not log matching requests

This example invokes the Create a zone ruleset rule operation to add a rule that:

- Skips the http_ratelimit phase
- Disables event logging for the current rule

Create a zone ruleset rule ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "action": "skip",    "action_parameters": {        "phases": [            "http_ratelimit"        ]    },    "logging": {        "enabled": false    },    "expression": "http.request.uri.path contains \"/disable-logging/\"",    "description": ""  }'
```

Refer to Available skip options: Logging for more information on disabling logging for requests that match a skip rule.

## Skip security products

This example uses the Create a zone ruleset rule operation to add a rule that skips the Zone Lockdown and User Agent Blocking products for requests matching the rule expression.

Create a zone ruleset rule ```
curl "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/$ZONE_ID/rulesets/$RULESET_ID/rules" \  --request POST \  --header "Authorization: Bearer $CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN" \  --json '{    "action": "skip",    "action_parameters": {        "products": [            "zoneLockdown",            "uaBlock"        ]    },    "expression": "http.request.uri.path contains \"/skip-products/\"",    "description": ""  }'
```

Refer to Available skip options for the list of products you can skip.

## Block Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover requests

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/block-ms-exchange-autodiscover/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/block-ms-exchange-autodiscover/)

Page options # Block Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover requests

In some cases, Microsoft Exchange Autodiscover service requests can be "noisy", triggering large numbers of HTTP 404 (Not found) errors.

This example custom rule blocks requests for autodiscover.xml and autodiscover.src:

- Expression: (ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "/autodiscover.xml") or ends_with(http.request.uri.path, "/autodiscover.src"))
- Action: Block

Alternatively, customers on a Business or Enterprise plan can use the matches comparison operator for the same purpose. For this example, the expression would be the following:

```
(http.request.uri.path matches "/autodiscover.(xml|src)$")
```

## Block requests by attack score

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/block-attack-score/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/block-attack-score/)

Page options # Block requests by attack score

The attack score helps identify variations of known attacks and their malicious payloads.

This example custom rule blocks requests based on country code (ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 ‚Üó format), from requests with an attack score lower than 20. For more information, refer to WAF attack score.

- Expression: (ip.src.country in {"CN" "TW" "US" "GB"} and cf.waf.score lt 20)
- Action: Block

## Challenge bad bots

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/challenge-bad-bots/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/challenge-bad-bots/)

Page options # Challenge bad bots

Cloudflare's Bot Management feature scores the likelihood that a request originates from a bot.

Note

Access to Bot Management requires a Cloudflare Enterprise plan with Bot Management enabled.

Bot score ranges from 1 through 99. A low score indicates the request comes from a script, API service, or an automated agent. A high score indicates that a human issued the request from a standard desktop or mobile web browser.

These examples use:

- cf.bot_management.score to target requests from bots
- cf.bot_management.verified_bot to identify requests from known good bots ‚Üó
- cf.bot_management.ja3_hash to target specific JA3 Fingerprints

## Suggested rules

For best results:

- Use Bot Analytics to learn about your traffic before applying rules.
- Start small and increase your bot threshold over time.

Your rules may also vary based on the nature of your site and your tolerance for false positives.

### General protection

The following three custom rules provide baseline protection against malicious bots:

Rule 1:

- Expression: (cf.bot_management.verified_bot)
- Action: Skip:

All remaining custom rules
- All remaining custom rules

Rule 2:

- Expression: (cf.bot_management.score eq 1)
- Action: Block

Rule 3:

- Expression: (cf.bot_management.score gt 1 and cf.bot_management.score lt 30)
- Action: Managed Challenge

### Specific protection for browser, API, and mobile traffic

#### Protect browser endpoints

When a request is definitely automated (score of 1) or likely automated (scores 2 through 29) and is not on the list of known good bots, Cloudflare blocks the request.

- Expression: (cf.bot_management.score lt 30 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot)
- Action: Block

#### Exempt API traffic

Since Bot Management detects automated users, you need to explicitly allow your good automated traffic‚Å† ‚Äî this includes your APIs ‚Üó and partner APIs.

This example offers the same protection as the browser-only rule, but allows automated traffic to your API.

- Expression: (cf.bot_management.score lt 30 and not cf.bot_management.verified_bot and not starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/api"))
- Action: Block

#### Adjust for mobile traffic

Since Bot Management can be more sensitive to mobile traffic, you may want to add in additional logic to avoid blocking legitimate requests.

If you are handling requests from your own mobile application, you could potentially allow it based on its specific JA3 fingerprint.

- Expression: (cf.bot_management.ja3_hash eq "df669e7ea913f1ac0c0cce9a201a2ec1")
- Action: Skip:

All remaining custom rules
- All remaining custom rules

Otherwise, you could set lower thresholds for mobile traffic. The following rules would block definitely automated mobile traffic and challenge likely automated traffic.

Rule 1:

- Expression: (cf.bot_management.score lt 2 and http.user_agent contains "App_Name 2.0")
- Action: Block

Rule 2:

- Expression: (cf.bot_management.score lt 30 and http.user_agent contains "App_Name 2.0")
- Action: Managed Challenge

#### Combine the different rules

If your domain handles mobile, browser, and API traffic, you would want to arrange these example rules in the following order:

- Rule for API traffic
- Rule(s) for mobile traffic
- Rule for browser traffic

### Static resource protection

Static resources are protected by default when you create custom rules using the cf.bot_management.score field.

To exclude static resources, include not (cf.bot_management.static_resource) in your rule expression. For details, refer to Static resource protection.

### Additional considerations

From there, you could customize your custom rules based on specific request paths (/login or /signup), common traffic patterns, or many other characteristics.

Make sure you review Bot Analytics and Security Events to check if your rules need more tuning.

## Configure token authentication

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/configure-token-authentication/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/configure-token-authentication/)

Page options # Configure token authentication

Token authentication allows you to restrict access to documents, files, and media to select users without requiring them to register. This helps protect paid/restricted content from leeching and unauthorized sharing.

There are two options to configure token authentication: via Cloudflare Workers or via custom rules.

## Option 1: Configure using Cloudflare Workers

Refer to the following Cloudflare Workers resources for two different implementations of token authentication:

- The Sign requests example.
- The Auth with headers template.

To get started with Workers, refer to Configure a Worker.

Note

The code provided in the Sign requests example is compatible with the is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() function used in Option 2. This means that you can verify requests signed by the example Worker script using a custom rule.

## Option 2: Configure using custom rules

Use the Rules language is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() HMAC validation function to validate hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) tokens in a custom rule expression.

Note

Access to the is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() HMAC validation function requires a Cloudflare Pro, Business, or Enterprise plan.

To validate token authentication, create a custom rule with a call to the is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() function in the rule expression. You can use an action such as Block.

### Example rule

This example illustrates a rule that blocks any visitor that does not pass HMAC key validation on a specific hostname and URL path. Details required for token authentication include:

- The secret key for generating and validating the HMAC (for example, mysecrettoken)
- The path you wish to authenticate (for example, downloads.example.com/images/cat.jpg)
- The name of the query string parameter containing the token (for example, verify)
- The token lifetime in seconds (for example, 3 hours = 10,800 seconds)

Consider the following example URL:

```
downloads.example.com/images/cat.jpg?verify=1484063787-9JQB8vP1z0yc5DEBnH6JGWM3mBmvIeMrnnxFi3WtJLE%3D
```

Where:

- /images/cat.jpg represents the path to the asset ‚Äî the HMAC message to authenticate.
- ?verify= is the separator between the path to the asset and the timestamp when the HMAC token was issued.
- 1484063787 represents the timestamp when the token was issued, expressed as UNIX time in seconds.
- 9JQB8vP1z0yc5DEBnH6JGWM3mBmvIeMrnnxFi3WtJLE%3D is a Base64-encoded MAC.

Warning

When you do not use the optional flags argument for is_timed_hmac_valid_v0(), you must URL encode the Base64-encoded MAC value. For more information, refer to HMAC validation.

The expression for the custom rule would be similar to the following:

```
(http.host eq "downloads.example.com" and not is_timed_hmac_valid_v0("mysecrettoken", http.request.uri, 10800, http.request.timestamp.sec, 8))
```

The components of this example custom rule (using the previous example URL) include:

- Token secret key = mysecrettoken
- Token lifetime = 10800 (10,800 seconds = 3 hours)
- http.request.uri = /images/cat.jpg?verify=1484063787-9JQB8vP1z0yc5DEBnH6JGWM3mBmvIeMrnnxFi3WtJLE%3D
- http.request.timestamp.sec = 1484071925 (for example)
- Separator length: len("?verify=") = 8

The is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() function compares the value of a MAC generated using the mysecrettoken secret key to the value encoded in http.request.uri.

If the MAC values match and if the token has not expired yet, according to the following formula:

```
http.request.timestamp.sec < (<TIMESTAMP_ISSUED> + 10800)
```

Then the token is valid and the is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() function returns true.

## HMAC token generation

The following examples show how you could generate tokens at your origin server for the path validated using the custom rule described in the previous section:

- Python 3.8
- Python 2.7
- PHP
- Workers

```
import hmacimport base64import timeimport urllib.parsefrom hashlib import sha256
message = "/images/cat.jpg"secret = "mysecrettoken"separator = "verify"timestamp = str(int(time.time()))digest = hmac.new((secret).encode('utf8'), "{}{}".format(message, timestamp).encode('utf8'), sha256)token = urllib.parse.quote_plus(base64.b64encode(digest.digest()))print("{}={}-{}".format(separator, timestamp, token))
```

```
import hmacimport base64import timeimport urllibfrom hashlib import sha256
message = "/images/cat.jpg"secret = "mysecrettoken"separator = "verify"timestamp = str(int(time.time()))digest = hmac.new(secret, message + timestamp, sha256)param = urllib.urlencode({separator: '%s-%s' % (timestamp, base64.b64encode(digest.digest()))})print(param)
```

```
<?php$message = "/images/cat.jpg";$secret = "mysecrettoken";$separator = "verify";$timestamp = time();$token = urlencode(base64_encode(hash_hmac("sha256", $message . $timestamp, $secret, true)));echo("{$separator}={$timestamp}-{$token}");
```



For a full example in JavaScript (JS) or TypeScript (TS), refer to the Sign requests example in the Workers documentation.

Since the example JS/TS implementation is compatible with is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() function, requests authenticated using the provided source code can be verified with a WAF custom rule and the is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() function.

This will generate a URL parameter such as the following:

```
verify=1484063787-9JQB8vP1z0yc5DEBnH6JGWM3mBmvIeMrnnxFi3WtJLE%3D
```

You will need to append this parameter to the URL you are protecting:

```
/images/cat.jpg?verify=1484063787-9JQB8vP1z0yc5DEBnH6JGWM3mBmvIeMrnnxFi3WtJLE%3D
```

Warning

The authentication token parameter (verify=<VALUE> in the example) must be the last parameter in the query string.

### Test the generated token parameter

If you are on an Enterprise plan, you can test if URLs are being generated correctly on the origin server by doing the following:

1. Set the custom rule action to Log.
2. Check the sampled logs in Security Events.

## Protect several paths using the same secret

You can use the same secret key to protect several URI paths.

This is illustrated in the previous example, where http.request.uri is passed as the MessageMAC argument to the validation function.

Since http.request.uri includes the path to the asset and that value is extracted for each request, the validation function evaluates all request URIs to downloads.example.com using the same secret key.

Note that while you can use the same secret key to authenticate several paths, you must generate an HMAC token for each unique message you want to authenticate.

## Protect an entire URI path prefix with a single signature

You can protect an entire fixed-length URI path prefix with a single HMAC signature (it would also use the same secret). To achieve this, supply a URI path prefix (instead of the full URI path) and the original query string as the MessageMAC argument for the is_timed_hmac_valid_v0() function.

Use the substring() function to obtain the prefix from the full URI path.

In the following example, the URI path prefix requiring a single HMAC signature is always 51 characters long (x is a character placeholder):

```
/case-studies/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx/
```

In this case, you would need to use a different HMAC signature for every different URI path prefix of length 51.

If you wanted to block requests for case study files failing the HMAC validation, you could create a custom rule similar to the following:



Rule expression:

```
(http.host eq "downloads.example.com" and starts_with(http.request.uri.path, "/case-studies") and not is_timed_hmac_valid_v0("mysecrettoken", concat(substring(http.request.uri.path, 0, 51), "?", http.request.uri.query), 10800, http.request.timestamp.sec, 1))
```

Action:

- Block

Example URI paths of valid incoming requests:

```
/case-studies/12345678-90ab-4cde-f012-3456789abcde/foobar-report.pdf?1755877101-5WOroVcDINdl2%2BQZxZFHJcJ6l%2Fep4HGIrX3DtSXzWO0%3D/case-studies/12345678-90ab-4cde-f012-3456789abcde/acme-corp.pdf?1755877101-5WOroVcDINdl2%2BQZxZFHJcJ6l%2Fep4HGIrX3DtSXzWO0%3D/case-studies/768bf477-22d5-4545-857d-b155510119ff/another-company-report.pdf?1755878057-jeMS5S1F3MIgxvL61UmiX4vODiWtuLfcPV6q%2B0Y3Rig%3D
```

The first two URI paths can use the same HMAC signature because they share the same 51-character prefix (/case-studies/12345678-90ab-4cde-f012-3456789abcde/) that is validated by the custom rule.

The third URI path needs a different HMAC signature, since the prefix is different.

## Exempt partners from Hotlink Protection

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/exempt-partners-hotlink-protection/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/exempt-partners-hotlink-protection/)

Page options # Exempt partners from Hotlink Protection

When enabled, Cloudflare Hotlink Protection blocks all HTTP referrers that are not part of your domain or zone. That presents a problem if you allow partners to use inline links to your assets.

## Allow requests from partners using custom rules

You can use custom rules to protect against hotlinking while allowing inline links from your partners. In this case, you will need to disable Hotlink Protection within the Scrape Shield app so that partner referrals are not blocked by that feature.

This example custom rule uses the http.referer field to target HTTP referrals from partner sites.

The not operator matches HTTP referrals that are not from partner sites, and the action blocks them:

- Expression: not (http.referer contains "example.com" or http.referer eq "www.example.net" or http.referer eq "www.cloudflare.com")
- Action: Block

## Allow requests from partners using Configuration Rules

Alternatively, you can create a configuration rule to exclude HTTP referrals from partner sites from Hotlink Protection. In this case, you would keep the Hotlink Protection feature enabled.

## Issue challenge for admin user in JWT claim based on attack score

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/check-jwt-claim-to-protect-admin-user/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/check-jwt-claim-to-protect-admin-user/)

Page options # Issue challenge for admin user in JWT claim based on attack score

Note

To use claims inside a JSON Web Token (JWT), you must first set up a token validation configuration in API Shield.

This example configures additional protection for requests with a JSON Web Token (JWT) with a user claim of admin, based on the request's attack score.

Create a custom rule that issues a Managed Challenge if the user claim in a JWT is admin and the attack score is below 40.

- Expression: (lookup_json_string(http.request.jwt.claims["<TOKEN_CONFIGURATION_ID>"][0], "user") eq "admin" and cf.waf.score < 40)
- Action: Managed Challenge

In this example, <TOKEN_CONFIGURATION_ID> is your token configuration ID found in JWT Validation and user is the JWT claim.

## Require a specific cookie

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/require-specific-cookie/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/require-specific-cookie/)

Page options # Require a specific cookie

To secure a sensitive area such as a development area, you can share a cookie with trusted individuals and then filter requests so that only users with that cookie can access your site.

Use the http.cookie field to target requests based on the presence of a specific cookie.

This example comprises two custom rules:

- The first rule targets requests to dev.www.example.com that have a specific cookie key, devaccess. As long as the value of the cookie key contains one of three authorized users ‚Äî james, matt, or michael ‚Äî the expression matches and the request is allowed, skipping all other custom rules.
- The second rule blocks all access to dev.www.example.com.

Since custom rules are evaluated in order, Cloudflare grants access to requests that satisfy rule 1 and blocks all other requests to dev.www.example.com:

Rule 1:

- Expression: (http.cookie contains "devaccess=james" or http.cookie contains "devaccess=matt" or http.cookie contains "devaccess=michael") and http.host eq "dev.www.example.com"
- Action: Skip:

All remaining custom rules
- All remaining custom rules

Rule 2:

- Expression: (http.host eq "dev.www.example.com")

## Require known IP addresses in site admin area

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/site-admin-only-known-ips/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/site-admin-only-known-ips/)

Page options # Require known IP addresses in site admin area

If an attack compromises the administrative area of your website, the consequences can be severe. With custom rules, you can protect your site‚Äôs admin area by blocking requests for access to admin paths that do not come from a known IP address.

This example custom rule limits access to the WordPress admin area, /wp-admin/, by blocking requests that do not originate from a specified set of IP addresses:

- Expression: (not ip.src in {10.20.30.40 192.168.1.0/24} and starts_with(lower(http.request.uri.path), "/wp-admin"))
- Action: Block

To prevent attackers from successfully using a permutation of /wp-admin/ such as /wP-AdMiN/, the expression uses the lower() transformation function to convert the URI path to lowercase.

## Require specific HTTP headers

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/require-specific-headers/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/require-specific-headers/)

Page options # Require specific HTTP headers

Many organizations qualify traffic based on the presence of specific HTTP request headers. Use the Rules language HTTP request header fields to target requests with specific headers.

## Example 1: Require presence of HTTP header

This example custom rule uses the http.request.headers.names field to look for the presence of an X-CSRF-Token header. The lower() transformation function converts the header name to lowercase so that the expression is case-insensitive.

When the X-CSRF-Token header is missing, Cloudflare blocks the request.

- Expression: not any(lower(http.request.headers.names[*])[*] eq "x-csrf-token") and (http.request.full_uri eq "https://www.example.com/somepath")
- Action: Block

## Example 2: Require HTTP header with a specific value

This example custom rule uses the http.request.headers field to look for the presence of the X-Example-Header header and to get its value (if any). When the X-Example-Header header is missing or it does not have the value example-value, Cloudflare blocks the request.

- Expression: not any(http.request.headers["x-example-header"][*] eq "example-value") and (http.request.uri.path eq "/somepath")
- Action: Block

The keys in the http.request.headers field, corresponding to HTTP header names, are in lowercase.

In this example the header name is case-insensitive, but the header value is case-sensitive.

## Require specific HTTP ports

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/require-specific-http-ports/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/require-specific-http-ports/)

Page options # Require specific HTTP ports

By default, Cloudflare allows requests on a number of different HTTP ports.

You can target requests based on their HTTP port with the cf.edge.server_port field. Use the in comparison operator to target a set of ports.

This example custom rule blocks requests to www.example.com that are not on ports 80 or 443:

- Expression: (http.host eq "www.example.com" and not cf.edge.server_port in {80 443})
- Action: Block

Open server ports and blocked traffic

Due to the nature of Cloudflare's anycast network, ports other than 80 and 443 will be open so that Cloudflare can serve traffic for other customers on these ports. In general, Cloudflare makes available several different products on Cloudflare IPs ‚Üó, so you can expect tools like Netcat and security scanners to report these non-standard ports as open in specific conditions. If you have questions on security compliance, review Cloudflare's certifications and compliance resources ‚Üó and contact your Cloudflare enterprise account manager for more information.

Custom rules and WAF Managed Rules can block traffic at the application layer (layer 7 in the OSI model ‚Üó), preventing HTTP/HTTPS requests over non-standard ports from reaching the origin server.

## Stop R-U-Dead-Yet? (R.U.D.Y.) attacks

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/stop-rudy-attacks/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/stop-rudy-attacks/)

Page options # Stop R-U-Dead-Yet? (R.U.D.Y.) attacks

R-U-Dead-Yet (R.U.D.Y.) attacks accomplish denial of service (DoS) by submitting long form fields. Use custom rules to stop these attacks by blocking requests that do not have a legitimate session cookie.

This example combines three expressions to target HTTP POST requests that do not contain a legitimate authenticated session cookie:

- The first expression uses the http.request.uri.path field to target the paths to secure from R.U.D.Y.:
http.request.uri.path matches "(comment|conversation|event|poll)/create"
- The second uses a regular expression to match the format of a legitimate auth_session cookie. The not operator targets requests where that cookie is not formatted correctly:
not http.cookie matches "auth_session=[0-9a-zA-Z]{32}-[0-9]{10}-[0-9a-z]{6}"
- The third expression targets HTTP POST requests:
http.request.method eq "POST"

To generate the final custom rule expression for this example, the three expressions are combined into a compound expression using the and operator. When an HTTP POST request to any of the specified URIs does not contain a properly formatted auth_session cookie, Cloudflare blocks the request:

- Expression: (http.request.method eq "POST" and http.request.uri.path matches "(comment|conversation|event|poll)/create" and not http.cookie matches "auth_session=[0-9a-zA-Z]{32}-[0-9]{10}-[0-9a-z]{6}")
- Action: Block

Note

The matches operator requires a Cloudflare Business or Enterprise plan.

## Update custom rules for customers or partners

**‰æÜÊ∫ê**: [https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/update-rules-customers-partners/](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/use-cases/update-rules-customers-partners/)

Page options # Update custom rules for customers or partners

You may want to adjust your custom rules to increase access by customers or partners.

Potential examples include:

- Removing rate limiting for an API
- Sharing brand assets and marketing materials

Warning

The example custom rules in this page can bypass Cloudflare's security features and are generally not recommended. Use with caution.

## Use ASN in custom rules

If a customer or partner is large enough, you could set up a custom rule based on an autonomous system number (ASN) ‚Üó.

### Allow traffic by ASN

This example uses:

- The ip.src.asnum field to specify the general region.
- The cf.bot_management.score field to ensure partner traffic does not come from bots.

Example custom rule:

- Expression: (ip.src.asnum eq 64496 and cf.bot_management.score gt 30)
- Action: Skip:

All remaining custom rules
- All remaining custom rules

Note

Access to Bot Management requires a Cloudflare Enterprise plan with Bot Management.

### Adjust rules by ASN

This example custom rule uses:

- The ip.src.asnum field to specify the general region.
- The cf.bot_management.score field to check if the request comes from a human.

If a request meets these criteria, the custom rule will skip User Agent Blocking rules.

- Expression: (ip.src.asnum eq 64496 and cf.bot_management.score gt 50)
- Action: Skip:

User Agent Blocking
- User Agent Blocking

## Use IP addresses in custom rules

For smaller organizations, you could set up custom rules based on IP addresses.

### Allow traffic by IP address

This example:

- Specifies the source IP address and the host.
- Uses the cf.bot_management.score field to ensure requests are not high-risk traffic.

Example custom rule:

- Expression: (ip.src eq 203.0.113.1 and http.host eq "example.com" and cf.bot_management.score gt 30)
- Action: Skip:

All remaining custom rules
- All remaining custom rules

### Adjust rules by IP address

This example custom rule specifies the source IP address and the host.

If a request meets these criteria, the custom rule will skip rate limiting rules.

- Expression: (ip.src eq 203.0.113.1 and http.host eq "example.com")
- Action: Skip:

All remaining custom rules
- All remaining custom rules
